| Aspect                    | ReAct Style (Prompt Only)       | Function Calling (Structured)              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| How tool is invoked       | Textual "Action: ToolName(...)" | Structured JSON function call              |
| Tool execution handled by | Manually parsing the output     | Native support (e.g. OpenAI, LangChain)    |
| Observation return format | Injected in plain-text          | Passed as function result programmatically |
