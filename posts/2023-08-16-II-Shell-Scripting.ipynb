    "### I.A. Why Bash Scripting\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone of us deals with files and directories. We search/move/delete/copy files. We look for a particular file or directory. We may even want to search a word/phrase in the files. With Bash, we can do those tasks at scale and at great speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "### I.B.  Why Bash Script Recipes\n",
    "\n",
    "Create your own simplified bash recipes for tasks that you do repetitively. The recipes could string together several bash commands underneath, but you have abstracted them for quick use\n",
    "\n",
    "### I.C.  What is in it for you \n",
    "The bash script recipes discussed here are intended for 2 purposes. The reader can\n",
    "1. directly use the recipes in their day-to-day work (like a mini cookbook), or \n",
    "2. use the recipes to learn the fundamentals and create their own recipes \n",

    "\n",
    "It is NOT a replacement for Python or Rust or even a [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/). Neither are the languages a replacement for Bash. But in combination with your core programming language, they are really powerful. \n",
    "\n",
    "If I take some technical liberty, you did not execute bash scripting when you used `find` , `grep`, `sed` and `awk`, you actually leveraged really efficiently written C codes (source). \n",
    "Unequivocally, it is a great skill in your toolbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bash scripting is foundational to Software Engineering and more pervasive than you think. If you have used `git`, `docker`, `kubectl` or even just `mkdir & cd`, you have tip-toed into bash scripting. Why not dive in?\n",
