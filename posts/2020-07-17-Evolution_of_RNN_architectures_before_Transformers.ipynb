    "**Why `dropout` won't work?**\n",
    " - Dropout, an algorithm that randomly(with a probability p) ignore units’ activations during the training phase allows for the regularization of a neural network.\n",
    " - By diminishing the probability of neurons developing inter-dependencies, it increases the individual power of a neuron and thus reduces overfitting. \n",
    " - However, dropout inhibits the RNNs capability of developing long term dependencies as there is loss of information caused due to randomly ignoring units activations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hence `drop connect`**\n",
    "- the drop connect algorithm randomly drops weights instead of neuron activations. It does so by randomly(with probability 1-p) setting weights of the neural network to zero during the training phase. \n",
