    "[Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/usage/) , written in Go and officially tagged as `task runner`, is giving us an intuitive and modular way to run any CLI command. \n",

    "- `task run_this_bash_script`\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, instead of running a command in a terminal, a repetitive `task` can be saved and run from a Taskfile.yml instead.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Whenever we build an application or even a part of that part application, we have a long list of setup terminal/CLI commands to execute. Often, those terminal commands are written in markdown files (like `Readme.md`). We are made to copy-paste those commands from the markdown file to run. \n",

    "- We have seen how useful taskfiles are for different types of requirements. Be it a AWS CLI or terraform script,a bash or python script, or a set of docker/K8s commands, abstract them away using easy to create and use taskfiles. \n",
    "- One more thing to note is that, environment variable values can be kept hidden in a `.env` (or `.any_file_name` for that matter.) You do not have to explicitly save them inside a git shared `Taskfile.yml`. This process ensures more security and replicability of the codebase across projects\n",
