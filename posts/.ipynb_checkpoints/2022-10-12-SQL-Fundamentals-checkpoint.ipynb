    "\n",
    "- Structured Query Language to access data from Relational databases\n",
    "- Case Insensitive: <br>\n",
    "    - SQL keywords are by default set to **case insensitive** \n",
    "    - The names of the tables and columns specification are set to case insensitive on the SQL database server, \n",
    "    - However, it can be enabled and disabled by configuring the settings in SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common data types in SQL (sqlite) and most important in other SQL tools\n",
    "\n",
    "- NULL. The value is a NULL value.\n",
    "- INTEGER. The value is a signed integer, stored in 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 bytes depending on the magnitude of the value.\n",
    "- REAL. The value is a floating point value, stored as an 8-byte IEEE floating point number.\n",
    "- TEXT. The value is a text string, stored using the database encoding (UTF-8, UTF-16BE or UTF-16LE).\n",
    "- BLOB. The value is a blob of data, stored exactly as it was input (image, audio, etc.,) <br>\n",
