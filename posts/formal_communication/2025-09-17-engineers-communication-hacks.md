#### Why am I even speaking on this topic?

<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">

> * Once upon a time, 15 years ago ....
> * I started my role as a Market Research Analyst in a Procurement-focused Management Consultancy Firm.
> * Typically, a Management consultancy has a team of Consultants and an army of Market Research (MR) Analysts. 
> * My first company combined the role of both Consultant and MR Analysts into one.
> * As a Consultant and a MR Analyst, I had a ton of opportunities to hone my communications skills

#### Why am I even speaking on this topic?

<div style="font-size: 0.7em;">

> * 💼 My Career: If I were an Asset Management Company, I’d have primarily invested in ***momentum*** funds. 
> * 🔄 Career Transitions from one momentum to another: ***Management Consulting*** → ***Analytics*** → Data Science → Deep Learning → Generative AI

> * 🥖🧈 Early Roles: My bread and butter in the first two roles - Management Consultancy and Analytics - ***depended heavily on communication skills***! <br>
> * I made cold-calls, sent lots of cold emails, prepared tonnes of reports and gave an equally substantial report explanation calls to clients in senior levels

## The Four Pillars

::: {.nonincremental}
- ***Active*** Listening 👂
- ***Mindful*** Reading 📖
- ***Deliberate*** Writing ✍️
- ***Clear*** Speaking 🗣️
:::

> - Your mind voice: "Just fancy, empty adjectives 🫙" <br>
> - But really, it’s about making everything active and intentional <br>
> - Practical tips and hacks coming up in the next slides 🚀

---

## What does it take to become a better communicator?

> * All four forms of communication are deeply interconnected 🔗 <br>
> * Better **listeners** become better **speakers** 👂➡️🗣️ <br>
> * Better **readers** become better **writers** 📖➡️✍️ <br>
> * Strong **writers** often become strong **speakers** — and vice versa 🔄


---


## 1. Active Listening

---

### ***Typical Instructions*** for Active Listening

* 🧘 Be present
* 🤔 Stay curious
* 👍 Acknowledge (nodding, verbal cues)
* 🔁 Reflect in your own words

> - Thanks, but no thanks 🙅 <br>
> - These tips are hard to practice—especially for *boring* topics 😅

---

### Listening - With Imaginative Subtitles

![](subtitles.png)

---

### Activate `Imaginative Subtitles`

My **go-to active listening hack** for boring topics:

* 🎬 Run a mental *subtitle track*

  * Words scroll across your mind’s screen on a black background
  * In a cursive, homebrew-style font
  * Sprinkled with emojis 🥤✨

* 📝 Make **nouns** stand out in **bold** and spice up adjectives with *italics*

---

### Listening - With Spectrogram

![](spectrogram.png)

---


### Listening — With Spectrogram 🎶

* In your imaginative *Netflix mind*, let the bottom strip run a `Spectrogram` 📊
* Actively notice every inflection in speech instead of just absorbing it subconsciously 🎧
* Is the delivery fiery like **Virat Kohli** 🔥 or calm like **Dhoni** 🧑🏼‍✈️🆒?
* Use it to gauge the ***passion*** in the speech — flat, wavy, smooth, evocative, or full of highs and lows 🌊


---

### Listening — With Toastmasters-like Metrics 🎤

Side effects of running mental subtitles:

- ✅ Spot grammatical slips
- 🔢 Track filler words — the classic “Ah Counter” (my favorite!)
- 🔁 Notice stammering or repeated sentence starts

---

#### Listening as Toastmasters — Grammar ✍️

<br> <br> <br>

- Common slip-ups: “I can able to…”, “She did not completed this …” ❌ <br>
- Unless you’re Sachin 🏏 or ARR 🎶, speaking correctly matters in the long run ✅

<br>

---

#### Listening as Toastmasters — Ah Counter 🔢

<br> <br> <br>

- My favorite metric: the Ah Counter! 🎯 <br>
- Filler words like “like”, “you know”, “but umm…” 🙃 <br>

--- 

#### Listening as Toastmasters — Crutch Phrases 🪃

<br> <br> <br>

- Common fillers: “Actually”, “At the end of the day…”, “Honestly speaking…” 🗨️ <br>
- Are some of these phrases being overused? 🤔

---

#### Listening as Toastmasters — Stammering ⏸️

<br> <br> <br>

- Examples: “I-I-I think we should…” or “So, so, so the plan is…” 🗣️ <br>
- Often caused by rushing thoughts or ideas racing ahead of words 🏃💭 <br>

<br>

---

#### Why Toastmasters-like Active Listening? 🎧✨

<br> <br> <br>

- It’s not about finding faults 🤦‍♂️💥
- These hacks help you become less self-critical ❤️‍🔥
- Nobody’s perfect—and that’s perfectly okay 👌🏼
- But acknowledgment is the first step to improvement ✔️
- Often, the simplest solution is just pausing more ⏸️

### Experienced Listener — Inferring Styles from a Speech 🎯

<br>

- Deductive ⬇️ — Top-down reasoning
- Inductive ⬆️ — Bottom-up reasoning
- Git Workflow 🔀 — Branching paths and merges
…
<br>

---

### Speech Style - Deductive: **Top-down Approach**

![](deductive_2.png)

> * "We need to refactor the payment module [main point]. <br>The current code has duplicated logic, poor error handling, and makes onboarding new developers difficult [details]."

> * 👉 Here, the decision/action comes first, followed by supporting evidence

---

### Speech Style - Inductive: **Bottom-up Approach**

![](inductive_3.png){width=300}


> * "The payment module has duplicated logic, poor error handling, and is hard for new developers to understand [details]. <br>That’s why we need to refactor it [main point]."

> * 👉 Here, the evidence builds up, and the conclusion is delivered last.

---

### Another Good Style: **Trunk and Feature Branches**


![](git_workflow.png)

---

### Hybrid Speech Styles

> Real-life: Most talks are like a hybrid of deductive-inductive. 

---

## 2. Second Pillar: Mindful Reading

---

### Importance of Writing for Better Reading Comprehension ✍️📖

- The world is flooded with content — whether from humans or AI 🌍💨
- The real question: Are we truly efficient at reading comprehension? 🤔

<br>

---


### Mindful Reading — Breaking Down Long Reads 📚✨

- **Problem**:
    - Long messages, reports, research papers, or documents can feel overwhelming 🤯
    - Passive scanning/reading gets you nowhere ❌

- ***Accountable*** Reading Hacks:
    - 📝 Headings Only — jot down one-word summaries
    - 😀👎❓ Emote It — copy each para/bullet and react to it
    - ✍️ Selective Self-Writing — add your own comment/summary to key sections

<br>

---

### Mindful Reading — Visual Structures 🧩

- Use Flowcharts or Tables to simplify complex text
- Tools: Pen & Paper ✍️, Mermaid Charts 🪄, Excalidraw 🎨, Draw.io 🖥️, etc.

![](visual_structures_2.png)


---

## 3. Third Pillar: Writing

---

### My Motto on Writing ✍️✨

<br>

- Time spent writing is never wasted ⏳
- Writing is how I learn 📖
- Writing is how I think 💡

<br>

---

### Avoid Agenda-less Meeting Invites or Hi!

> - Avoid sending a meeting invite which does not have an agenda <br>
> - Never, ever send Empty "Hi/Hello" and waiting for others to respond. Always add an one-line context


<br>

---

### The Importance of Writing Before Calling ✍️ → ☎️

<br> 

- Yes, call and explain things 👥 — but prepare a pre-meeting write-up (if not for others, for yourself ). <br>
- A short write-up before the meeting helps everyone align better ✅

<br>
---

### Document-Driven Meetings — Any Takers? 📄🚀

<br> 

- At Amazon, problem-solving meetings start with a structured written memo instead of a slide deck 📝
- The **two-page memo** received over **50 comments** 📑📝 before the call
- The engineer felt disheartened initially 😓 but soon realized the **writing and thinking** required significant improvement 💡
---

## Fourth Pillar: Speaking

---

### Achieving Exceptional Speaking Skills 🎤✨

<br>  
<br>  

> * Mastering **listening, reading, and writing** is key to exceptional speaking 👂📖✍️ 
> * No matter where you are now—never underestimate your **long-term potential** 🚀 

<br>  

---


### Meeting Room Conversations vs Public Speeches 🏢🎤


> * Chasing **public speaking perfection** is a wrong goal (for most of us) ❌
> * Nobody wants a **Sashi Tharoor-style** monologue in every day meeting discussions 😅

> * Instead, let us focus on making  everyday **meeting room conversations** effective!

<br>  

---

### How to Improve Meeting Room Conversations

> * Improve your speech following the ***Toastmasters*** metrics
> * Use the **Speech Styles** to make your thoughts coherent
> * Practice **thinking on your feet**, which transfers to public speaking naturally 💡
