    "The sam package command is used to package an AWS SAM application. It creates a .zip file of your code and dependencies, and uploads them to an S3 bucket. It also returns a copy of your AWS SAM template, replacing references to local artifacts with the Amazon S3 location where the command uploaded the artifacts.\n",

    "Consistency: Whether your application is simple or complex, the process to package and deploy it remains the same. This can make it easier to manage and automate deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Versioning: When you upload your code to an S3 bucket, you have a centralized place to manage and version your code. This can make it easier to roll back deployments, share code across multiple environments, and track changes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integration with AWS SAM and AWS CloudFormation: The sam package and sam deploy commands are designed to work seamlessly with AWS SAM and AWS CloudFormation. This means you can define your application's resources, permissions, and event sources in a single AWS SAM template, and AWS SAM will handle the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large applications: If your application's deployment package is larger than 50 MB, you must upload it to an S3 bucket. The sam package command handles this for you.\n",
