## Introduction 


While countless resources teach "top X commands in Git", many fail to catapult a beginner to an advanced one in a practical way. Those resources explain the details of a command but not the situation that warranted the use of the command. In this code-along blog post, readers can understand "why a git command was used" and "how to use it". 

In this blog, I am hoping the readers can
- gain confidence in using hard-to-understand git commands in a real-world-like scenario <br>
- test their acquired knowledge by [completing Linux Foundation's Git exam](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/skillcred/git/)  <br>

**Pre-requisites**: <br>
- Any good terminal you are comfortable with <br>
- Install `git` <br>
- A music streaming app in your mobile app playing [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wYIbH2I5GZk) (ok, that was just for me!) <br>

## 1. How is the blog structured? 

> Short Answer: Like a real-world scenario involving a team of collaborators in Git

 - Typically, a team of developers works on a software product and collaborate via Git. 
 - In this blog, a team of writers writes stories for an amazing comic universe, all the while collaborating in Git. This is an attempt to give that typical developer scenario a fun twist!

Fig 2. A git tutorial featuring a fictional team of scriptwriters unfurling a comic, superhero universe | Pic Source: Author 

- I am going to use 1 `LeadScriptWriter` (dev)  branch and 3 `Writer` (feature) branches.

> Some would suggest [Trunk-based development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development) is better. This debate on the **git branching model** is out of the scope of this blog.

## 2. "Hey, just tell me, what am I going to learn here?" 

In a fun, practical, and replicable way, we are going to cover the following beginner to advanced git commands

```

# Dev Branch: dev/LeadScriptWriter/Context (for miscellaneous set of useful commands)

- git commit --amend 
- git diff
- git rebase -i commit-hash & git push

# Feature Branch 1: Writer1/MainHeroes (for `reset`)
- git reset --soft commit-hash
- git merge --ff-only

# Feature Branch 2: Writer2/OtherHeroes (for `rebase`)
- git switch feature && git rebase main
- git merge --ff-only

# Feature Branch 3: Writer3/EndGame (for `revert`)
- git revert
- git merge --no-ff

# Merge `dev` with `main`
- git merge --no-ff
- git tag
```

## 3. The Bare-minimum Git Theory 

> Skip this section if you are already aware of the basics

### 3.1 **What is Git**?
	- Git is **a version control software** that runs locally. Git is primarily a command-line tool. 
	- You do not need a GitHub/GitLab or other remote repo account to use Git locally. 
	- You need a remote repo like GitHub/GitLab when you wish to **collaborate** and **share** your repository with the outside world. 

```bash
% mkdir -p sample_git_dir
% cd sample_git_dir
% git init
# ---
```

### 3.2 **What are `git add`(staging area) and `git commit` commands?**
	- Before you `commit`, you add your changes to `a staging area`.  
	- You can add many files to the staging area. You save the progress of all those files via a `commit`.


```bash
% pwd
/some/path/to/sample_git_dir
% echo "file1" > file1.txt && echo "file2" > file2.txt
# Before you `commit`, you add your changes to a `staging` area.
# You can add many files to the staging area.
% git add file1.txt file2.txt
# You save the progress of all those files via a `commit`. 
% git commit -m "first commit"
# ---
```


### 3.3 **What is a `HEAD`?**
	- HEAD is **a pointer** that refers to the "current location" or the "current commit" you are on, in your repository

```bash
% echo "file3" > file3.md
% git add file3.md
% git commit -m "second commit"
# ----

# note that the `HEAD` is at the commit `85de13a`
% git log --oneline
ed71ef7 (HEAD -> main) second commit
331ee7b first commit
```

- Note that I did not say "latest commit" in the previous sentence :) Whichever commit you are currently "checking out", that commit becomes the HEAD
- Generally, the HEAD is on the `latest commit` in a branch you are working. 
- You could go to a specific commit `git checkout commit-hash-or-tag`. Then you would be on a `detached HEAD` (not to worry!). You can create a new branch from that `detached HEAD` position or simply go back to an existing branch.


```bash
# Even if you progress further, you could go back to any specific commit
% git checkout 331ee7b
Note: switching to '331ee7b'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 331ee7b updating files of type txt
```

- When you are in a `detached HEAD` state in a particular commit, the state of files then would be shown. In other words, new files or updates created after that commit would not be visible. 

```bash
# the file `file3.md` was not created during this commit `7db0093`
% ls
file1.txt file2.txt
# --- 

# I am going from this detached HEAD state back to the `branch`
% git status
HEAD detached at 331ee7b
nothing to commit, working tree clean

```

- You can always switch to any branch to come out of the `detached HEAD`
```
% git checkout main
Previous HEAD position was 331ee7b updating files of type txt
Switched to branch 'main'

% ls
file1.txt file2.txt file3.md
```

### 3.4 **Btw, what exactly is a branch?**
- Branches are like alternate `timelines`! We can work on multiple tasks in parallel branches or have different branches just to simply separate the different tasks. 
- Each branch in a git repo has a specific set of associated commits. 

```bash
# what are the branches you have now
% git branch --list -a
* main

% git status
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean

% cat file1.txt 
file1


# create and switch to that branch
% git switch -c sample_branch_1

# add more contents to `file1.txt`
% echo "\nMore contents here ..." >> file1.txt
% git add file1.txt && git commit -m "third commit"
```

- Making changes on one branch does not affect other branches until we merge them. 

```bash
# what is the content of `file1.txt` in `sample_branch_1`?
% git show sample_branch_1:file1.txt
file1

More contents here ...

# what is the content of `file1.txt` in `main`
% git show main:file1.txt
file1
```

### How do I merge 2 branches?
	- Let us merge a "feature" branch into "main"

```bash
# currently the HEAD is in `sample_branch_1` branch
% git log --oneline --all                          
2bf38e2 (HEAD -> sample_branch_1) third commit
ed71ef7 (main) second commit
331ee7b first commit

% git status
On branch sample_branch_1
nothing to commit, working tree clean

% git switch main

% git merge sample_branch_1
Updating ed71ef7..2bf38e2
Fast-forward
 file1.txt | 2 ++
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)

# Now, let us see file1.txt again
% git show main:file1.txt
file1

More contents here ...

% git log --oneline
2bf38e2 (HEAD -> main, sample_branch_1) third commit
ed71ef7 second commit
331ee7b first commit
```


### 3.5 What is a `.git` directory?

The `.git` directory is essentially the heart of Git. That is what makes version control work.

When you initialize a Git repository using `git init`, this directory is created at the root of your project. Below is an overview of the structure and contents of the `.git` directory:

#### Key Components of the `.git` Directory
There are more files and directories than the below ones but I am focusing the spotlight on items I have historically noticed. 

##### 1. **Files**

- `.git/config` A file containing repository-specific configuration

```bash
% cat .git/config
[core]
	repositoryformatversion = 0
	filemode = true
	bare = false
	logallrefupdates = true
	ignorecase = true
	precomposeunicode = true
[user]
	email = youremail@something.com
	name = Your Name
```


- `.git/HEAD` - Refers to the current branch's latest commit

```bash
% cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/main
```


- `.git/index` - Serves as the staging area for changes, holding metadata like timestamps and filenames along with their SHA-1 hashes in binary form

What is the difference between `working directory` and `index`  terms in `.git` directory?
- **Working Directory**: This is the actual directory where project files are located. Modifications made to files in the working directory are considered 'untracked' until explicitly staged for commit. 
- **Staging Area (Index)**: The staging area acts as an intermediate step between the working directory and the `.git` directory


- Skipping explanations for other files like ORIG_HEAD, FETCH_HEAD (you can explore [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitrepository-layout) )
```
% find .git -type f -name "*" -depth 1
.git/ORIG_HEAD
.git/config
.git/HEAD
.git/description
.git/index
.git/packed-refs
.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG 
```


##### 2. **Directories**

```bash
% find .git -type d -name "*" -depth 1
.git/filter-repo
.git/objects
.git/info
.git/logs
.git/hooks
.git/refs
```

- `.git/refs`  - This directory contains references to commits that are pointing to branches or tags

```bash
% tree -L 3 .git/refs      
.git/refs
├── heads
└── tags

# stores the commit id where main branch is pointing to
% cat .git/refs/heads/main
331ee7b90c8ba8a0cdc1a2d2824198114fd82bf7

% git log --oneline
331ee7b (**main**) first commit
```

- `.git/logs` - Stores reference logs (hint: reflogs - `git reflog` ) that track changes to branch tips, aiding in recovery and auditing processes.

```bash
% tree -L 3 .git/logs         
.git/logs
├── HEAD
└── refs
    └── heads
        ├── main
        └── sample_branch_1

3 directories, 3 files
```


- `.git/objects` contains information about 3 types of objects stored here 

```
- Blobs (content of files),
- Trees (directories),
- Commits and Tags (commit metadata).
```

- Want to learn what are `.git/objects` hands-on? Follow the commands below. 

```bash
% mkdir -p git-objects-demo && cd git-objects-demo && git init
% echo "Hello Reader" >> my_blog_reader.txt
% git add my_blog_reader.txt && git commit -m "first commit"
% tree -L 3 .git/objects

committer Your Name <your_email@something.com> 1739191036 +0530

first commit
```

- I am skipping explanations about `.git/hooks` (warrants a blog on its own about `precommit hooks`)
- `.git/filter-repo` directory helps in rewriting history.

## 4. Learning Git by Way of Practice 

> Now, let us move on to the moderate to advanced stuff
### 4.1 Branch 1: `dev/LeadScriptWriter/Context`

![](./images_2/4_1.png)
Fig 4.1.1 A quick summary of what we are going to do in this section (4.1)

> In this branch `dev/LeadScriptWriter/Context` , the Lead Script Writer is setting up the context

- Create a directory and set up git there

```bash
% mkdir -p comic_universe
% cd comic_universe

# The below command sets up the `.git` directory that helps in version control
% git init

# The below command helps git know who the committer is
% git config user.email "youremail@something.com" && git config user.name "Your Name"
% git status
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```



```
A (main)
```

- Create a dev branch or, in our case `dev/LeadScriptWriter/Context` 

```bash
% touch comic_heroes.md
% git add comic_heroes.md && git commit -m "A: first commit - empty file"
% git switch -c dev/LeadScriptWriter/Context
```


- A pictorial representation of the commits so far (you could try `git log --oneline`)
- The HEAD of the branch is depicted in the diagram
```
A (main, dev)
```


![](./images_2/4_1_2.png)

- Now, let us explore `git diff` and `git commit --amend` commands
```bash
% git status
On branch dev/LeadScriptWriter/Context
nothing to commit, working tree clean

% echo "> In this document, all writers contribute their efforts\n" >> "comic_heroes.md"

### 4.2 Branch 2: `Writer1/MainHeroes`

![](./images_2/4.2.png)
Fig 4.2.1 A quick summary of section (4.2)


- Now, let us switch to the `Writer1` branch and start writing about 3 main Heroes in `comic_heroes.md`

```
- **Iron Man:** Created the Iron Man suit and saved himself from captivity.
- **Captain America:** Led the charge against Hydra during WWII and became a symbol of hope.
- **Thor:** Defended Asgard and Earth, wielding Mjolnir with unshakable valor.
```

```bash
% git switch Writer1/MainHeroes
% cat comic_heroes.md
> In this document, all writers contribute their efforts

## About the Main Heroes

## Other Heroes

## The EndGame

# add the lines about Main Heroes
% vi comic_heroes.md

- "Please remove `DeadPool` completely. Since no others have used your branch yet. "
- "Kindly use `git reset commit-before-deadpool-commit` and reset all the changes. "
- "DO IT NOW!"

- Writer1 gets into action to implement what the Lead suggested.

## About the Main Heroes
- **Iron Man:** Created the Iron Man suit and saved himself from captivity.
- **Captain America:** Led the charge against Hydra during WWII and became a symbol of hope.
- **Thor:** Defended Asgard and Earth, wielding Mjolnir with unshakable valor.

## Other Heroes

## The EndGame

- Note, I could have used `git reset --mixed` or `git reset --hard` as well (verify the `The Git Manual` using `git reset --help` for more details)


- Progress so far
```
A (main)
  \
   B' (dev,Writer2,Writer3)
	 \
      W1-A (Writer1)
```

- Time to merge `Writer1` branch with `dev` branch
- We are doing a Fast Forward Merge. This is an "implicit" merge and is possible only when `dev` and `Writer1` branches have not diverged. Here, we DO NOT have divergent branches. 

```bash
% git switch dev/LeadScriptWriter/Context
% git merge Writer1/MainHeroes --ff-only
```

- We have moved the tip of `dev` branch to the commit `W1-A` pointed at by `Writer1`

- Progress so far:

```
A (main)
  \
   B' (Writer2,Writer3)
	 \
      W1-A (dev, Writer1)
```


### 4.3 Branch 3: `Writer2/OtherHeroes`

![](./images_2/4_3.png)
A quick summary of section (4.3)

> While `Writer1` was creating stories about the main heroes, `Writer2` was writing stories about other heroes.

```bash
% git switch Writer2/OtherHeroes
```

- Content for Other Heroes

```
- **Hulk:** Balanced a life of science with his uncontrollable strength to smash enemies.
- **Black Panther:** Protected Wakanda and shared Vibranium with the world.
- **Captain Marvel:** Fought galactic threats and became a cosmic force for good.
- **Ant-Man:** Mastered the Quantum Realm to fight villains on a microscopic scale.
```



- Note that the changes made by Writer1  to `dev` branch are not visible yet.  But `Writer 2` makes his commit

- Writer2 realizes that it is better to "rebase" the new changes in `dev` under `Writer2` , before merging `Writer2` with `dev`

```bash
% git rebase dev/LeadScriptWriter/Context
Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/Writer2/OtherHeroes.

- The Lead upon reviewing this, wanted to "revert" the "PostEndGame" commit of `W3-B` . He wanted EndGame chapter to not have any End Credit scene.


- Writer3 get back to "reverting" the PostEndGame commit `W3-B'`
```bash
% git log --oneline

	 \
      W1-A -- W2-A (dev, Writer2)
```

- Merge `Writer3` with `dev` branch

```bash
# now let us merge `Wrtier3` branch with `dev` branch
% git switch dev/LeadScriptWriter/Context
% git merge Writer3/EndGame --no-ff
Auto-merging comic_heroes.md

```

- The ‘ort’ strategy refers to the “Optimized Recursive Three-Way Merge” strategy
- A merge commit `MC` was created when combining the `dev` branch and the `Writer3` branch.



### 4.5: Merge `dev` with `main` and `tag`

![](./images_2/4_5.png)

- As per `Git Flow` branching model, we are merging a stable branch like `dev` now to `main`


```bash
% git switch main 
% git merge dev/LeadScriptWriter/Context --no-ff
Merge made by the 'ort' strategy.
 comic_heroes.md | 22 ++++++++++++++++++++++

```

- From this `main` branch we can tag the commit for future reference 

```bash
% git tag EndGameCommit
% git log --oneline --graph --all

### 4.6 Bonus: How do `cherry-pick`, `merge conflicts` work

![](./images_2/4_6.png)
![](./images_2/4_6_2.png)


- Now, Writer4 starts to expand the story beyond EndGame.

```bash
% git checkout dev/LeadScriptWriter/Context
% git switch -c Writer4/PostEndGame
% vi new_heroes.md
# write about Legend of the 10 Rings
% cat new_heroes.md
# Post EndGame
- **Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings**: Shang-Chi confronts his past and unlocks his true potential while battling the mysterious Ten Rings organization.
- git add new_heroes.md && git commit -m "W4-A: 10 Rings Hero"
```
- Lead tells Writer4 to cherry-pick a commit about `PostEndGame` by Writer3

```bash
% git log --oneline
f2135dc (HEAD -> Writer4/PostEndGame) W4-A: 10 Rings Hero
460daed (dev/LeadScriptWriter/Context) MC: Merge branch 'Writer3/EndGame' into dev/LeadScriptWriter/Context

>>>>>>> 6fdd729 (W3-B: PostEndGame)
```

- The changes between `<<<<` and `=====` are from the initial source `Writer4/PostEndGame`
- The changes from `======` and `>>>>>` are from the cherry-picked commit `6fdd729 (W3-B: PostEndGame)`
- Let us resolve it manually

```bash
% vi new_heroes.md
% cat new_heroes.md

- Falcon becomes Captain America and fights Red Hulk
- World gets a new band of Superheroes called Thunderbolts
```

- Now, let us continue the steps mentioned in `git cherry-pick <commit>`

```bash
% git add new_heroes.md
% git cherry-pick --continue

## 5. Remote Git Learnings

### 5.1 `Remote` Repositories

- A **local repository** is the Git repository stored on your local computer (whatever we have seen so far). Typical commands- git add, git commit, git log 
- A **remote repository** is a Git repository hosted on a server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or self-hosted). It allows multiple developers to collaborate by pushing and pulling changes. Typical commands- git push, git pull, git fetch 


In this blog, we have seen git merge and git rebase but we have not done git fetch , git pull and git push. 
The following explanation, about push to and pull from an online repo, can hopefully put you in good stead in real-world scenarios. 


- For the sake of the demonstrating push and pull in local laptop, let us setup an alternate directory as a remote

> Underlying foundation: Whether it is Local or Remote, you are working with branches


**How does a `pull` command works?**

![](./images/git_pull.png)

- `git pull origin branch_name` == `git fetch origin branch_name && git switch branch_name && git merge origin/branch_name`




- Also, there are different strategies for `git pull` (essentially different `merge` strategies):
	- `git pull --ff` (fast forward)
	- `git pull --no-ff` and 
	- `git pull --rebase`.
- All of the above different merge strategies had been dealt with in the previous section. 
- Why `git pull --ff-only` is a safe option: [link](https://blog.sffc.xyz/post/185195398930/why-you-should-use-git-pull-ff-only)


**How does a `push` command work?**

![](./images/git_push.png)

- When you do `git push origin branch_name`, the following commands happen:
	- `git reverse-fetch branch_name` (this is a **fictional** command of my own that just indicates the contents of `branch_name` are pushed to remote server)
	- In the remote_server, you would switch to the origin/branch_name `git switch origin/branch_name`
	- In the remote_server, you would merge the new changes from `branch_name` with `origin_branch_name`


![](./images/remote_learnings.png)

- Putting above learnings to practice. 
- Did I not say `Whether it is Local or Remote, you are working with branches`? Let me prove that in an example below

<br>

```bash
% mkdir -p remote_learnings

# `remote_learnings` 1s an empty directory
remote_learnings % ls

# create 3 sub directories to help in learning `clone`, `push`, `fetch` and `pull` commands
remote_learnings % mkdir -p local_server_1 local_server_2 remote_server


# create a local git repo in `local_server_1` directory
remote_learnings % cd local_server_1
remote_learnings/local_server_1 % mkdir -p fav_books && cd fav_books

# create a file `harry_potters_series.txt ` and list down the names of the books
remote_learnings/local_server_1/fav_books % vi harry_potters_series.txt 

remote_learnings/local_server_1/fav_books % cat harry_potters_series.txt

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix: The fifth book in the series

**Key Takeaway**:
> If you have understood the underlying foundation of commits and branches, there is not much difference between a remote repo and a local repo. They are just different branches in different locations :).

### 5.3 What is a `Pull/Merge Request`? 

A **Pull Request** (PR) is a feature commonly associated with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket, rather than being a fundamental aspect of Git itself.

#### Features of Pull Requests

- **Code Review**: Pull requests enable team members to review code changes, provide feedback, and suggest improvements before integration.
- **Discussion**: They serve as a platform for discussion about the proposed changes, allowing for comments on specific lines of code.
- **Integration with CI/CD**: Many platforms integrate pull requests with Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, automatically running tests on the proposed changes.

### 5.3. How to Contribute to Open Source Public Repositories?

> `fork -> clone, edit & push -> pull request`

#### Fork the Original Public Repo (OPR)

Example: <br>
- **Original Public Repo** (OPR): https://github.com/explosion/spaCy <br>
- **Forked-OPR** (F-OPR): https://github.com/mribbons/spaCy/tree/master <br>
- **Pull Request Page**: https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/pull/13613 <br>
- **A PR Example**: https://github.com/explosion/spaCy/pull/13613/commits/228045464b15de57483926228cb5d045b75998b9 
  - SomePerson is requesting to merge 2 commits into `explosion:master` from his own forked `SomePerson:master`

## 6. Conclusion

There are many more git commands that I have not explored here (a few useful ones that come to my mind - `git bisect` , `git worktree`, `git stash pop`, [`git filter-repo`](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo/)). 

I believe you could practice all of the above missed commands on your own now, without an iota of fear, by extending the story!

If you feel the above material was a breeze, you could secure the Linux Skill Cred Git certification like me ([my_credly_linux_cert](https://www.credly.com/badges/aa76e1a3-877b-4f39-ba68-f4447bc05d18)).

Did you completely git it? 
Happy Git Committing!

## 7. Epilogue

**Are you looking to further your knowledge beyond what I have covered?** 
- Another feature of git that I could not dig deeper into here is [pre-commit hooks](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-hooks) (`.git/hooks`). Precommit hooks can be used to keep the codes & files that enter git clean and in the format we want. 

- After committing your code to an online repository in GitHub, GitLab, or elsewhere, a pipeline can be triggered to build (the environment), test (your code), and finally deploy your application. That pipeline is commonly called Continuous Integration/ Continuous Delivery (CICD). You could learn that [here](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/devops-and-sre-fundamentals-implementing-continuous-delivery-lfs261/)
