    "## 1. Quick Introduction to Probability:\n",
    "- Probability - Odds of a particular event happening over all possible outcomes \n",
    "- Prob = <sup> # of Desired Outcomes </sup> / <sub> Total # of Possible Outcomes </sub>\n",
    "- Basic types of Probability: <br>\n",
    "    - Classical Probability\n",
    "    - Empirical Probability\n",
    "    - Subjective Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both Classical and Empirical Probabilities are Objective Probabilities where\n",
    "    - in Classical: The odds won't change. They are based on `formal reasoning`. They based on established events/theory. \n",
    "        E.g.: flipping a fair coin, picking a card from a usual pack of 52 cards\n",
    "    - in Emprical: The odds are based on `experimental or historical data`\n",
    "        E.g.: What is the chance of a particular player scoring above 50 runs this match?\n",
    "        (this can be determined by the historical data of that player)\n",
    "- Subjective probabilities are based on `personal beliefs`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Types of odds: \n",
    "    - Even Odds | Equally likely events\n",
    "        - E.g.: Flipping a coin or Rolling a fair die\n",
    "    - Weighted Odds | Events with unequal chances of occuring \n",
    "        - E.g.: Chances of occurrence of rain in Chennai today\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. How to **count number of possible outcomes**?\n",
    "- `Permutations`: If interested in the order of things\n",
    "    - E.g.: What is the chance for Students A and B to win top 2 prizes of a competition from a class of 10; There are 8 contestants and 3 prizes. How many different possible outcomes are there?\n",
    "    - nPk = <sup>n!</sup> / <sub>(n-k)!</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Combinations`: If order is not important\n",
    "    - E.g.: What are the number of ways you can pick 4 members from a team of 12 members?\n",
    "    - nCk = <sup>n!</sup> / <sub>k!*(n-k)!</sub>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Q1) There are 8 contestants and 3 prizes. How many different possible outcomes are there?**\n",
    "    - \"Permutations\" problem because **order** is important\n",
    "    - 8! / (8-3)! = 8 X 7 X 6 = 336\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Q2A) In how many ways can you \"pick\" 4 member team from a total 12 members?**\n",
    "     - \"Combinations\" problem\n",
    "     - 12! / 4! * (12-4)! = 495\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Q2B) In how many of these 495 combinations, do sisters Layla and Olivia join the same team?**\n",
    "     - Assuming the sisters have already been inducted into the team,there are \n",
    "         -`10! / 2! * (10-2)!=45` ways to pick the remaining two members  \n",
    " \n",
    "- `Percentile Rank` = Percentile rank of a given score is the percentage of scores in its freq distribution that are less than that score\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "    PR =( CF' + (0.5 X F) ) / N * 100\n",
    "\t\tCF' = Cumulative Freq (excluding the current score) = Count of all scores less than the score of interest\n",
    "\t\tF  = Freq of the score of interest \n",
    "        N = Total number of scores in the distribution\n",

    "    - Heads or Tails <br>\n",
    "    - Rain or No Rain <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. of Multiple event probabilities: <br>\n",
    "*Sports Example*: <br>\n",
    "    - 30% chance of a player scoring a goal <br>\n",
    "    - 40% chance of that player's team winning <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q) Is there a relationship between the team winning and this player's success in scoring?** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Healthcare example*: <br>\n",
    "    - 1/ 10K people gets a particular rare disease <br>\n",
    "    - Test is accurate only 98% of the time <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q) What are the chances a person who is tested positive is actually false positive?** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "*Employment example*: <br>\n",
    "    - Only 4 out of 20 get an interview <br>\n",
    "    - What is the prob that friends Mohan and Lily both get a slot in the interview? <br>\n",
    "    - What if Mohan gets one of the 4 slots, what is the prob of Lily securing one of the other 3 slots? <br>\n",
