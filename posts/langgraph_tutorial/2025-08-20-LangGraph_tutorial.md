title: "What I Learned about LangGraph from FreeCodeCamp Tutorial Video"
output-file: 2025-08-20-agentic-ai-oreilly.html
---

I recently completed a tutorial by Vaibhav Mehra on FreeCodeCamp in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGg_1h0qzaM) and [Github](https://github.com/iamvaibhavmehra/LangGraph-Course-freeCodeCamp/tree/main)

I learned quite a few things from that. I have compiled my notes from the course below.

---

## Intro - A TL;DR Version

In this blog, I share my key learnings from Vaibhav Mehra’s LangGraph tutorial, focusing on building graphs and agentic AI workflows using LangGraph framework.

- The tutorial starts with Python type annotations (TypedDict, Union, Optional, Any, Lambda), then 
- explains core LangGraph concepts (such as Node, State, Graph, etc.,) and finally 
- moves on to building agents - Chatbot, ReAct, and RAG Agents

The tutorial walks through building various LangGraph workflows:

- Hello World Graph: A single-node graph updating state.
- Multiple Inputs Graph: Handling structured state with lists.
- Sequential Graph: Chaining nodes for stepwise state transformation.
- Conditional Graph: Routing execution based on state values.
- Looping Graph: Repeating nodes until a condition is met.

It then demonstrates agent integration with LLMs:

- Simple Bot & Chatbot: Maintaining conversation history and message types.
- ReAct Agent: Using tools (add, subtract, multiply) with structured tool calls.
- Drafter Agent: Human-in-the-loop document drafting and saving.
- RAG Agent: Retrieval-Augmented Generation using PDF documents, embeddings, and ChromaDB for answering questions based on document content.

> While the actual tutorial used OpenAI, I modified it to run locally using Ollama models - llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0 for LLM and nomic-embed-text for embedding

## I. Type Annotations (Python basics that are used in LangGraph)

1. **Typed Dictionary** is used for expressing `State` of an Agent

```python
# normal dictionary

movie = {
    "name": "Avengers EndGame",
    "year": 2019
}


# Typed dictionary

from typing import TypedDict 

class Movie(TypedDict):
    name: str
    year: int

movie = Movie(name="Avengers Endgame", year=2019)
```


**Normal Dictionary - pros and cons**:

- **pros**:
    - Flexible data retrieval
    - Efficient data retrieval
- **con**:
    - Cannot enforce structure or type


**Type Safe Dictionary**   resolves the negative by enforcing type, while being easy to code and read


2. **Union**

```python
from typing import Union

def square(x: Union[int, float]) -> float:
    return x * x 
```

Even if I had given below, it will work. 

```python
def square(x: float) -> float:
    return x * x
```

- Python's type hints are not enforced at runtime—they are mainly for static type checkers 
- If you want to enforce the type at runtime, you need to add an explicit type check inside the function:

```python
def square(x: float) -> float:
    if not isinstance(x, float):
        raise TypeError("x must be a float")
    return x * x
```

---

3. **Optional**

```python
from typing import Optional 

def message(name: Optional[str]) -> None:
    if name is None:
        print("No name was provided")

    else:
        print(f"Hey {name}")
```

- In the above case `name` parameter can be `Optional`. So either `str` or None is allowed (but not anything else)

---

4. **Any**:

```python
from typing import Any

def print_value(x: Any) -> None:
    print(x)
```


---

5. **Lambda Function**:

```python
square = lambda x: x*x
square(10)

nums = [1,2,4]

squares = list(map(lambda x: x*x, nums))
```

- Lambda is used for writing small functions

---

## II. Elements

1. **State**

- State is a shared data structure
- Holds the context of the application; In other words, keeps the application's memory

> Analogy: Imagine a room with people starting at a whiteboard. The Participants are *nodes*. The Whiteboard is the *state* that holds the updated information

```python
# State: shared data structure
state = {"counter": 0, "user": "Alice"}
```

2. **Nodes**

- Nodes are individual functions or operations that perform specific tasks within the *graph*

> Analogy: Imagine a factory assembly line. Node is the function that each station in the assembly line does (such as painting, fixing, etc.,) 

```python
# Node: function that performs a specific task
def increment_counter(state):
    state["counter"] += 1
    return state
```

3. **Graph**

- Graph in a LangGraph is the structure that maps out how different tasks are connected and executed. 

- Graph represents the workflow showing sequence and conditional paths between various operations

> Analogy: Graph is a like a road map interconnecting cities. You can move from 1 node to the other through different nodes in the middle. 

```python
# Graph: structure mapping tasks and their connections
nodes = {
    "start": lambda state: state,
    "increment": increment_counter,
    "end": lambda state: state
}

graph = ["start", "increment", "end"]
```

4. **Edges**

- Edges are the connections between nodes that determine the flow of execution
- Edge dictates which node should be executed next after the current one completes its task.

```python
# Edge: connection between nodes
edges = {
    "start": "increment",
    "increment": "end"
}
```

5. **Conditional Edges**

- Conditional Edges are specialized connections that decide the next node to execute based on specific conditions or logic applied to the current state.

```python
# Edge: connection between nodes
edges = {
    "start": "increment",
    "increment": "end"
}
```

6. **START** and **END**

- The START node is a virtual entry point in LangGraph, marking where the workflow begins. There is no operation performed here
- The END node signifies the conclusion of the workflow in LangGraph. Upon reaching this node, the workflow is completed. 

```python
# START and END nodes
def start_node(state):
    print("Workflow begins")
    return state

def end_node(state):
    print("Workflow completed")
    return state
```

7. **Tools**:

- (Sub)Functions that nodes utilize to perform specific tasks like fetch data using an API
- Nodes are part of the Graph Structure. Tools are used within the nodes

```python
# 7. Tools: Functions used by nodes
def fetch_data(api_url):
    # Simulate fetching data from an API
    return {"data": f"Fetched from {api_url}"}
```

8. **ToolNode**:

- A special kind of node whose main job is to run a tool 
- ToolNode runs a tool

```python
# 8. ToolNode: Node that runs a tool
def tool_node(state, tool, *args, **kwargs):
    result = tool(*args, **kwargs)
    state["tool_result"] = result
    return state


# Specific example connecting to the 7.Tools function
def tool_node(state, fetch_data, api_url):
    result = fetch_data(api_url)
    state["tool_result"] = result
    return state
```

9. **StateGraph**:

- StateGraph is a `class` in LangGraph that is used to build and compile a Graph Structure. Much like a blueprint of a building 

```python
# 9. StateGraph: Class to build and run a graph
class StateGraph:
    def __init__(self, nodes, edges, start_node):
        self.nodes = nodes
        self.edges = edges
        self.current_node = start_node
        self.state = {}

    def run(self, initial_state):
        self.state = initial_state
        while self.current_node != "end":
            node_func = self.nodes[self.current_node]
            self.state = node_func(self.state)
            self.current_node = self.edges.get(self.current_node, "end")
        return self.state
```

10. **Runnable**:

- A Runnable in LangGraph is a standardized, executable component that performs a specific task within an AI workflow.
- While a node will typically receive a state, perform an operation and return the updated state, a runnable could mean many modular operations
- It serves as a fundamental building block, allowing for us to create modular systems. 
- Much like Lego Blocks

```python
# 10. Runnable: Standardized executable component
class Runnable:
    def __init__(self, func):
        self.func = func

    def run(self, *args, **kwargs):
        return self.func(*args, **kwargs)
```


11. **Messages**:
- Human Message: Represents input from a user.
- System Message: Used to provide instructions or context to the model
- Function Message: Represents result of a function call
- AI Message: Responses from an AI model
- Tool Message: Similar to Function message, but specific to tool usage

```python
# 11. Messages: Different message types
class HumanMessage:
    def __init__(self, content):
        self.type = "human"
        self.content = content

class SystemMessage:
    def __init__(self, content):
        self.type = "system"
        self.content = content

class FunctionMessage:
    def __init__(self, result):
        self.type = "function"
        self.result = result

class AIMessage:
    def __init__(self, response):
        self.type = "ai"
        self.response = response

class ToolMessage:
    def __init__(self, tool_name, args, result):
        self.type = "tool"
        self.tool_name = tool_name
        self.args = args
        self.result = result
```

**Personal Notes from my Understanding**:

**Difference between Graph and StateGraph**
- A Graph in LangGraph is a general structure that defines nodes and edges (the workflow and connections).
- A StateGraph is a specialized class in LangGraph that manages the state as it moves through the graph. It is used to build, compile, and execute the workflow, keeping track of the shared state.
- A StateGraph does not necessarily comprise many Graphs; rather, it is an implementation of a graph that is state-aware.

**Is Tool Message used to pass arguments to tools?**
- Yes, a Tool Message is used to represent the invocation of a tool, including passing arguments and receiving results. It is similar to a Function Message but specific to tool usage.

## III. Graph 1 - Hello World Graph

**Objectives**:
- Understand and **define the AgentState** structure
- Create a **simple node function** to process and update state
- *Set up* a basic LangGraph structure
- *Compile* and invoke a LangGraph graph
- Understand how data flows through *a single-node in LangGraph*

```python
from typing import Dict, TypedDict
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph 
# StateGraph - framework that helps you design and 
# manage the flow of tasks in your application using a graph structure

# define the state
# We now create an AgentState - a shared data structure 
# that keeps track of information as your application runs. 

class AgentState(TypedDict): # Our state schema
    message : str 

# a node accepts the state and returns a state 
# in the format of the "AgentState"
def greeting_node(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """Simple node that adds a greeting message to the state"""
    state['message'] = f"Hey {state['message']}, how is your day going?"
    return state 


# instantiate the class
graph = StateGraph(AgentState)

# add a nde to the graph
graph.add_node("greeter", greeting_node)

graph.set_entry_point("greeter")
graph.set_finish_point("greeter")

# compile the graph (once all nodes are added)
app = graph.compile()

# display the mermaid version of the graph
# app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()

result = app.invoke({"message": "Bob"})
result["message"]
```

## IV. Graph 2 - Multiple Inputs Graph

> Goal: Learn how to handle multiple inputs

**Objectives**:
- **Define a more complex AgentState**
- Create **a processing node** that performs operations on list data.
- *Set up* a LangGraph that processes and outputs computed results.
- *Invoke* the graph with structured inputs and retrieve outputs.


```python
from typing import TypedDict, List
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph

# defining an agent structure
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    values: List[int]
    name: str
    result: str


# defining a processing node
def process_values(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """This function handles multiple state inputs"""
    print(f"Before processing: {state}")
    state["result"] = f"Hi there {state['name']}, Your sum is {sum(state['values'])}"
    print(f"After processing: {state}")
    return state

# instantiate the StateGraph class
graph = StateGraph(AgentState)

graph.add_node("processing_node", process_values)
graph.set_entry_point("processing_node") # set the start entrypoint
graph.set_finish_point("processing_node") # set the finish entrypoint

app = graph.compile() # compiling the graph

# app.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()

result = app.invoke({"name": "Senthil", "values": [0,1,1,2,3,5]})
print(result)
```

## V. Graph 3 - Sequential Graph

**Objectives
- Create **multiple nodes** that sequentially process and update different parts of the State
- Connect the nodes together in a graph
- Invoke the Graph and see how the state is transformed step by step

```python
from typing import TypedDict

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    name: str
    age: str
    final: str


def first_node(state:AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """This is the first node of our sequence"""

    state["final"] = f"Hi {state["name"]}!"
    return state

def second_node(state:AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """This is the second node of our sequence"""

    state["final"] = state["final"] + f" You are {state["age"]} years old!"

    return state


graph = StateGraph(AgentState)

graph.add_node("first_node", first_node)
graph.add_node("second_node", second_node)

graph.set_entry_point("first_node")

    finalNumber: int

def adder(state:AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """This node adds the 2 numbers"""
    state["finalNumber"] = state["number1"] + state["number2"]

    return state

def subtractor(state:AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """This node subtracts the 2 numbers"""
    state["finalNumber"] = state["number1"] - state["number2"]
    return state


def decide_next_node(state:AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """This node will select the next node of the graph"""

    if state["operation"] == "+":
        return "addition_operation"
    
    elif state["operation"] == "-":
        return "subtraction_operation" 


graph = StateGraph(AgentState)

graph.add_node("add_node", adder)
graph.add_node("subtract_node", subtractor)
graph.add_node("router", lambda state:state) # passthrough function

graph.add_edge(START, "router") 

graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "router",
    decide_next_node, 

    {
        # Edge: Node
        "addition_operation": "add_node",
        "subtraction_operation": "subtract_node"
    }

)

graph.add_edge("add_node", END)
graph.add_edge("subtract_node", END)

app = graph.compile()


result = app.invoke({"number1": 10, "operation": "-", "number2": 5})
print(result)

>> {'number1': 10, 'operation': '-', 'number2': 5, 'finalNumber': 5}
```

def greeting_node(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """Greeting Node which says hi to the person"""
    state["name"] = f"Hi there, {state["name"]}"
    state["counter"] = 0 

    return state

def random_node(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """Generates a random number from 0 to 10"""
    state["number"].append(random.randint(0, 10))
    state["counter"] += 1

    return state


def should_continue(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """Function to decide what to do next"""
    if state["counter"] < 5:
        print("ENTERING LOOP", state["counter"])
        return "loop"  # Continue looping
    else:
        return "exit"  # Exit the loop

> To use the codes in the below section, ensure you have pulled Ollama model `llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0`

Points to Note about Ollama via LangChain: 
- Ollama runs as a local server daemon (by default on http://localhost:11434) <-- ensure Ollama is running 
- When you call model.invoke(...), LangChain’s ChatOllama client sends an HTTP request to that server.
- Ollama loads the model weights into memory (VRAM/RAM) if they’re not already loaded.
- The model stays cached in memory after the first request — so subsequent requests are much faster.
- The model is not “shut down” after each request. It remains warm and available as long as the Ollama server is running.

In the below python files or in your jupyter notebook, if needed, please use the below code piece

```python
# -------------------- OPTIONAL: UNLOAD MODEL --------------------
# By default, Ollama keeps the model in memory (cached) for faster reuse, even if you have "exited"
# If you want to explicitly unload it after running, uncomment the code below.
#
# try:
#     subprocess.run(["ollama", "stop", "llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0"], check=True)
#     print("✅ Ollama model 'llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0' stopped and unloaded from memory.")
# except Exception as e:
#     print(f"⚠️ Could not unload Ollama model: {e}")
```

## VIII. Agent 1 - Simple Bot



Main Goal: How to integrate LLMs in our Graphs

**Objectives**:
- Define state structure with a list of HumanMessage objects.
- Using LangChain's ChatOllama and running a Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model
- Process node that accepts query (in state["messages"]) and just prints the 
- Building and compiling the graph of the Agent

```python
from typing import TypedDict, List
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage
from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatOllama
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# Define state structure with a list of HumanMessage 
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: List[HumanMessage]

# Using LangChain's ChatOllama and running a Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model
llm = ChatOllama(model="llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0")

def process(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    response = llm.invoke(state["messages"])
    print(f"\nAI: {response.content}")

    return state

graph = StateGraph(AgentState)
graph.add_node("process", process)

## IX. Agent 2 - Chatbot

**Objectives**
- Use different message types - HumanMessage and AIMessage
- Maintain a full conversation history using both message types
- Use Llama 3.1 8B instruct model
- Create a sophisticated conversation loop

```python
from typing import TypedDict, List, Union
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage
from langchain_community.chat_models import ChatOllama
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# Define state structure with a list of HumanMessage 
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: List[Union[HumanMessage, AIMessage]]

# Using LangChain's ChatOllama and running a Llama 3.1 8B Instruct model
llm = ChatOllama(model="llama3.1:8b-instruct-q8_0")

def process(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    response = llm.invoke(state["messages"])
    state["messages"].append(AIMessage(content=response.content)) 
    print(f"\nAI: {response.content}")
    print("CURRENT STATE: ", state["messages"])
    
    return state

graph = StateGraph(AgentState)
graph.add_node("process", process)
graph.add_edge(START, "process")
graph.add_edge("process", END)
agent = graph.compile()

conversation_history = []

user_input = input("Enter: ")
while user_input != "exit":
    conversation_history.append(HumanMessage(content=user_input))
    result = agent.invoke({"messages": conversation_history})
    conversation_history = result["messages"]
    user_input = input("Enter: ")


with open("logging.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Your Conversation Log:\n")
    
    for message in conversation_history:
        if isinstance(message, HumanMessage):
            file.write(f"You: {message.content}\n")
        elif isinstance(message, AIMessage):
            file.write(f"AI: {message.content}\n\n")
    file.write("End of Conversation")

print("Conversation saved to logging.txt")
```
```bash
!cat logging.txt

Your Conversation Log:
You: Hi Name is Senthil
AI: Hello Senthil! Nice to meet you. Is there something I can help you with or would you like to chat?

You: Waht is my name
AI: Your name is Senthil.

End of Conversation
```

================================ Human Message =================================

Add 40 + 12 and then multiply the result by 6. Also tell me a joke please.
================================== Ai Message ==================================

To perform the operations you've requested, I'll start by adding 40 and 12.

{ 'tool': 'add', 'args': { 'a': 40, 'b': 12 } }

This will give us a result of 52.

Now, let's multiply this result by 6:

{ 'tool': 'multiply', 'args': { 'a': 52, 'b': 6 } }

The result is: 312

And here's a joke for you:

What do you call a fake noodle? An impasta!

Would you like to hear another one or perform more calculations?

You have access to ONE tool:
- retriever_tool(query: str): searches the indexed PDF and returns relevant passages.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
- If you need to look anything up before answering, call the tool.
- When you call a tool, you MUST reply only with a SINGLE JSON object in this exact form:
  {{ "tool": "retriever_tool", "args": {{ "query": "<your search query>" }} }}
- Do NOT include any other text with the JSON.
- After receiving tool results, synthesize a clear, concise answer. Cite the specific snippets (e.g., "Doc 2, page 5") that support your answer.
- If the document doesn't contain the answer, say so explicitly.

Keep answers grounded in the document. Avoid speculation. Temperature is set to {LLM_TEMPERATURE} to minimize hallucinations.

What is your question (type 'exit' to quit):  ticket symbol for Apple

=== ANSWER ===
The ticket symbol for Apple is not explicitly mentioned in the provided PDF chunks. However, based on the text, it can be inferred that the stock ticker for Apple is likely "AAPL", as it is commonly known and widely used.

This inference is supported by the fact that the document mentions Apple's stock price and market capitalization without specifying a ticker symbol. Additionally, the mention of Alphabet (Google) with its ticker symbol "GOOGL" suggests that the document uses standard ticker symbols for publicly traded companies.

Therefore, based on this analysis, I would suggest that the ticket symbol for Apple is likely "AAPL".

What is your question (type 'exit' to quit):  How did Tesla perform in the 2024 Stock market?

=== ANSWER ===
Tesla performed well in the 2024 stock market, with its share price ending the year up approximately 63% (Doc 1, page 4 and Doc 2, page 4). However, the company faced volatility during the first half of 2024 due to concerns about slowing EV demand and tighter profit margins, causing shares to decline substantially from their late-2023 levels (Doc 1, page 4).

The trend reversed dramatically in the final months of 2024, with virtually all of Tesla's yearly gains coming in the fourth quarter. The stock skyrocketed after the U.S. presidential election in November 2024, bolstered by a more business-friendly administration and hopes for renewed demand and pricing power in the EV market (Doc 4, page 4). By December 2024, Tesla's stock was trading near record highs, briefly touching an all-time closing high of around $480 per share in mid-December (Doc 4, page 4).

Overall, while Tesla faced challenges during the first half of 2024, its strong performance in the fourth quarter ultimately led to a significant annual gain.

## Conclusion

In this blog post, I’ve kept all tools local - Llama 3.1 8B Instruct int_8 model, Ollama Embedding, ChromaDB,etc.,  (unlike the original tutorial, which relied on the OpenAI APIs). This way, we can learn and practice locally without external dependencies.

LangGraph is a flexible framework. At its core, it treats AI agentic tasks as graphs/workflows, which is the foundation of its flexibility. Each node in the workflow can execute Python functions, meaning you can seamlessly integrate any agentic framework.

Here’s an excellent example that combines LangGraph + Strands Agent + MCP:
