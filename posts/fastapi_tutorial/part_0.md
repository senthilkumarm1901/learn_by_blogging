## Python Fundamentals Power FastAPI - A Quick View
FastAPI quietly uses a lot of Python concepts underneath - Python type hints, PyDantic validation, and async framework, among a few others.

Here are going to uncover them one bye one.

- The same Python language's features power two different dimensions in FastAPI.
- On one side, they directly affect runtime behavior — validation, concurrency, and error handling.
- On the other, they dramatically improve developer experience — auto-generated docs, schemas, and clean dependency injection.
