How spread out is the data?\nAlong with “Middle” point, look for variability - Range: (Max - Min) \nTelling stories with mean and median is still limited. With `Range` it becomes better\n\n|        | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Mean   | 60    |\n| Median | 58    |\n| Range  | 70    |\n\nStandard Deviation:\n\nApprox Definition: Average of all data point’s distances from the mean\nProper Definition: Square Root of { the mean of {Square of the difference between each data point and the mean of the data}}\nStd Deviation of the population:  σ = √( Σ(X - μ)2/ N );\nX = Value in the data distribution  μ = Mean of the population  N = Number of data points\nStd Deviatin of Sample:  s = √ (  Σ(X - x̄ )2  /  (n-1) )\nWhy the denominator is n - 1 in Sample Std Deviation? \n\nx̄ is the mean of the sample\nBy empirical evidence (observed in many datasets),  Σi=1N (xi - x̄)2 &lt;&lt; Σi=1N (xi - μ)2 \nHence dividing the sample std deviation by (n-1) makes it “unbiased” and more towards population std deviation \nAnother Explanation: There are only (n-1) degrees of freedom in the calculation of (xi - x̄)\n\n\nZ-Score:\n\nA particular datapoint’s distance from the mean measured in standard deviations Z-score = ( X - μ /  σ )\n= (231 - 139) / 41 = 2.24 = 231 is 2.24 std deviations from the mean = 112 is -0.66 std deviations from the mean\n\nInteresting points:\n\nStd deviations of two different datasets cannot be compared (e.g.: Salaries of Data Scientists and Consumption of Fuel in cars)\n\n\n\n\n3. Empirical Rule (or the 68-95-99.7 rule)\n\nMost of the datapoints (68%, 95%, 99.7% ) fall within some std deviations (1,2, and 3 respectively) from the mean\nIn other words, 99.7% of the data that is normally distributed will lie 3 standard deviations from the mean.\nWhat is normal distribution?  The dataset distribution mimics a bell curve\nApplication of the Empirical Rule:\n\nUnderstanding if a particular data point being an outlier or not\n\n\n\n\n4. Central Limit Theorem\n\nGiven a population of unknown distribution with mean μ and finite variance σ2,\n\nIf we keep sampling n values from the the distribution, and compute sample mean as  X̄n ~= (  X1 + X1 + Xn  / n)\nAs n-&gt; ∞, the distribution of the sample means tend to be normal or gaussian (following the bell curve)\n\nIn simple words, \n\nIf you have a population with unknown distribution but with a mean of μ and std deviation of σ and take sufficiently large number of samples n (with replacement), the distribution of means will be approximately normally distributed  \n\nWith the help of CLT, we need not wait for the entire population’s data (and the subsequent identification of the population’s unknown distribution), we can apply normal distribution principles (like the empirical rule and many more statistical techniques) on the sample means and draw a conclusion about the population\n\nMore about CLT with an example:  - Central Limit Theorem’s super power - “You don’t need to know the population distribution”\n\n\n\n5. Outlier:\n\nOutlier is a relative term. There is no absolute definition (like if a datapoint is 2 or 3 σ away from the mean)\nHow to investigate outliers:  (one should not simply ignore/remove it)\n\nIs this really an outlier?\nHow did this happen?\nWhat can we learn?\nWhat needs to change (to make it fit into the distribution)?\n\n\nSource: - LinkedIn Courses - Statistics Foundations: Probability and Statistics Foundations: The Basics | refer"

Validation data then would have “seen” training data\n\n\nExample 1 - Nike: \n\nObjective: How much shoelace material will be used?\nSituation: With the feature Leather used this month , the prediction accuracy is 98%+. Without this featur, the accuracy is just ~80%\nIsDataLeakage?: Depends !\n\n❌ Leather used this month is a bad feature if the number is populated during the month (which makes it not available to predict the amount of shoe lace material needed)\n✔️ Leather used this month is a okay feature to use if the number determined during the beginning of the month (making it available during predition time on unseen data)\n\n\n\nExample 2 - Nike: \n\nObjective: How much shoelace material will be used?\nSituation: Can we use the feature Leather order this month?\nIsDataLeakage? Most likely no, however ...\n\n❌ If Shoelaces ordered (our Target Variable) is determined first and then only Leather Ordered is planned,  then we won’t have Leather Ordered during the time of prediction of unseen data\n✔️ If Leather Ordered is determined before Shoelaces Ordered, then it is a useful feature\n\n\n\nExample 3 - Cryptocurrency: \n\nObjective: Predicting tomo’s crypto price with a error of &lt;$1\nSituation: Are the following features susceptible to leakage?\n\nCurrent price of Crypto\nChange in the price of crypto from 1 hour ago\nAvg Price of crypto in the largest 24 h0urs\nMacro-economic Features\nTweets in the last 24 hours\n\nIsDataLeakage? No, none of the features seem to cause leakage.\nHowever, more useful Target Variable Change in Price (pos/neg) the next day. If this can be consistently predicted higher, then it is a useful model\n\n\nExample 4 - Surgeon's Infection Rate Performance: \n\nObjective: How to predict if a patient who has undergone a surgery will get infected post surgery?\nSituation: How can information about each surgeon’s infection rate performance be carefully utilized while training?\n\nThe independent features are strictly data points collected until the surgery had taken place\nThe dependent variable - whether infected or not - should be post surgery measurement\n\nIsDataLeakage? Depends on the what are the features used.\n\nIf a surgeon’s infection rate is used as a feature while training the model (that predicts whether a patient will be infected post surgery), that will lead to data leakage"

Better the ExteriorQuality, more the SalesPrice\nTypical values: If two variables have a MI score of 0.0 - they are totally indepndent.\nMutual Information is a logarithmic quantity. So it increases slowly\nMutual Information is a univariate metric. MI can’t detect interactions between features Meaning, if multiple features together make sense to a dependent variable but not independently, then MI cannot determine that. Before deciding a feature is unimportant from its MI score, it’s good to investigate any possible interaction effects\n\nParallel Read for MI like metrics:\n\nFeature Importances from fitted attribute\n\nRecursive Feature Elimination\n\n\n\n\nTypes of New Features:\n\nMathematical Transformations (Ratio, Log)\nGrouping Columns Features - df['New_Group_Feature'] = df[list_of_boolean_features].sum(axis=1) - df['New_Group_Feature'] = df[list_of_numerical_features].gt(0).sum(axis=1) gt – greater than\nGrouping numerical Rows Features - customer['Avg_Income_by_State'] = customer.groupby('State')['Income'].transform('mean')\nGrouping categorical columns features - customer['StateFreq'] = customer.groupby('State')['State'].transform('count')/customer.State.count()\nSplit Features - df[[‘Type’, ‘Count’]] = df[‘some_var’].str.split(” “,expand=True)\nCombine Features - df['new_feture'] = df['var1'] + \"_\" + df['var2']\n\n\n\nUseful Tips on Feature Engineering:\n\nLinear models learn sum and differences naturally\nNeural Networks work better with scaled features\nRatios are difficult for many models, so can yeild better results when incorporated as additional feature\nTree models do not have the ability to factor in cound feature\nClustering as feature discovery tool (add a categorical feature based on clustering of a subset of features)\n\n\n\nPrincipal Component Analysis\n\nPCA is like partitioning of the variation in data\nInstead of describing the data with the original features,\nyou do an orthogonl transformation of the features and compute “principal components”\nwhich are used to explain the variation in the data.\nConvert the correlated variables into mutually orthogonal (uncorrelated) principal components\nPrincipal components can be more informative than the original features\nAdvantages of PCA: - Dimensionality Reducton - Anamoly Detection - Boosting signal to noise ratio - Decorrelation\nPCA works only for numeric variables; works best for scaled data\n\nPipeline for PCA: original_features –&gt; Scaled_features –&gt; PCA Features –&gt; MI_computed_on_PCA_features\n\n\n\nTarget Encoding\n\nTarget Encoding: A Supervised Feature Engineering technique for encoding categorical variables by including the target labels\nTarget Encoding is basically assigning a number to a categorical variable where in the number is derived from target variable - autos['target_encoded_make'] =  autos.groupby('make')['Price'].transform('mean')\nDisadvantages of Target Encoding: - Overfits for low volume (rare) classes - What if there are missing values\n\nWhere is Target Encoding most suitable? - For High cardinality features - Domain-motivated features (features that could have been scored poorly using feature importance metric function, we can unearth its real usefulness using target encoding)"

    "text": "1. Introduction to AI Agents\n\n1.1 Overview of AI Agents and Their Applications\nDefinitions of AI Agents \n\nBusiness Definition: AI agents are systems that exhibit autonomy, decision-making, and adaptation. They can operate independently, learn from feedback, and improve over time.\nTechnical Definition: Agents are LLMs + prompts under the hood. Agents are prompts layered on top of LLMs, combined with tools and context to achieve specific goals.\n\nAgents vs LLMs\n\nLLMs: Generate human-like text\nAgents: Generate human-like text, perform tasks, and make their own decisions.\n\nCore Components of an Agent\n\nLLM: The model(s) needed for generating text and making decisions\nTask/Goal: Example – “Go to thiswebsite.com and summarize.”\n\nTools: Example – A web scraper.\n\nContext: Example – “You are an AWS expert. Check the full website and scroll through all components.”\nPrompt: Combines task and context, while knowing what tools are available.\n\nExample of an Agent: ChatGPT is an agent because it has access to tools like: \n\nWeb search\n\nDALL·E for image generation\n\nPython execution tool\nUser profile context (memory about you)\n\nSingle vs Multi-agent\n\nChatGPT = Single agent with sequential task flow.\n\nOpenAI Swarm = Enables consistent agent handoffs.\n\nAutoGen = Multi-agent system for asynchronous, distributed deployments.\n\nOther examples of agents: \n\nReplit Agent: Develops apps from scratch.\n\n\n\n\n1.2 Leading AI Agent Frameworks\nTwo major frameworks stand out: \n\nLangChain & LangGraph: Known for code standardization and stateful workflows. (focused more in this blog)\nCrewAI: Focused on collaborative, role-based agents.\n\nWhy LangChain/LangGraph?\n\nStandardized workflows\n\nStateful multi-actor applications\n\nHuman-in-the-loop support\n\nOther notable frameworks:\n\nSmolAgents (HuggingFace)\n\nStrandsAgents (Amazon)\n\n\n\nWhile I have ignored the CrewAI codes discussed in the course, you can find the Hello World of CrewAI here\n\n\n\n\n1.3 Designing Multi-step Workflows with LangGraph\nSinan (the author of the O’Reilly course) emphasizes LangGraph for its:\n\nStateGraph\n\nStateful execution\n\nTraceability and reproducibility\n\nApproach differences:\n\nCrewAI: Assign tasks and tools, let it figure out execution.\n\nLangGraph: Hardcode everything and dictate the flow.\n\n\n📘 LangGraph Hello World – Key Highlights of this Jupyter Notebook\n\n🧰 A.

    "text": "2. Under the Hood of AI Agents\n\nThis section explains why agents need auto-regressive LLMs, how they reason, and what makes frameworks like CrewAI useful.\n\n\n2.1 Evolution of Auto-regressive LLMs\nWhat is Language Modeling?\nLanguage modeling is the process of generating a probability distribution over sequences of words. In simpler terms, it predicts the next word in a sequence.\nEvolution of NLP Models (Image Description):\n\n2001: Neural Language Models\n\n2013: Encoding Semantic Meaning with Word2Vec\n\n2014–2017: Seq2Seq + Attention\n\n2017–Present: Transformers and Large Language Models\n\nTypes of Language Models\n\nAuto-encoding LMs – The Readers\n\n\nLearn the entire sequence by predicting tokens using past and future context.\n\nGreat at reading and understanding text, but cannot generate text.\n\nExamples: BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet, sBERT\n\nBest for: Classification, Embedding, Retrieval tasks\n\n\nAuto-regressive LMs – The Generators\n\n\nPredict the next token using past context only.\n\nGreat at writing and generating text.\n\nExamples: GPT, Claude\n\nThese are Generative LLMs capable of reasoning and conversation, but limited by context window size.\n\nWhy Auto-regressive LLMs Matter for Agents\nMost AI agents rely on these models to:\n\nDecide which tool to use\n\nDetermine tool inputs and arguments\n\nDecide when to return the final answer\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Tools of AI Agents\nDirect Tool Calling vs Agentic Frameworks\n\nDirect LLM Tool Calling: Offers maximum control and customization.\n\nAgentic Frameworks (e.g., CrewAI): Ideal for orchestrating multi-agent workflows.\n\n\nIn the same CrewAI Notebook, Sinan shows how he has built a Search + Email Agent to send personalized cold emails. The workflow: Search Task → Email Task\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Key Components of Agent Frameworks: ReAct Reasoning\nMost frameworks use the ReAct pattern:\nThought → Action → Observation → Response\n\nThought: Decide what to do next\n\nAction: Execute a tool or step\n\nObservation: Analyze the result\n\nResponse: Produce the final answer\n\n\nLLM “thinks” about which tool to activate, performs the “action”, “observes” the result, and loops back if needed or gives the “response”\n\n\nAgents often need multiple tools. After each observation, the agent may return to Thought and select another tool. This iterative reasoning is what makes agents powerful for complex tasks.\n\n\n\n\n2.4 Another Definition of Agents - Workflows with Discrete Checkpoints\nAgents operate as workflows with discrete checkpoints:\n\nDid the AI pick the right tool?\n\nDid it use the tool correctly?\n\nDid the tool succeed?\n\nWas the returned information correct?\n\nDid the AI use the info properly?\n\nDid it pick the next tool correctly?\n\nThis loop continues until the final response is ready."

    "section": "4. Testing and Evaluating AI Agents",
    "text": "4. Testing and Evaluating AI Agents\n\nEvaluating AI agents is as critical as building them. Poor evaluation can lead to unreliable systems, biased decisions, and poor user experience.\n\n\n4.1 Core Evaluation Metrics\n\nResponse Time\n\nA quick gut check on performance.\n\nExample: ChatGPT is fast because it uses a small set of tools (web, DALL·E, Python, bio), reducing complexity.\n\nAccuracy\n\nMeasures correctness of decisions and outputs.\n\nTask Completion Rate\n\nHow often agents successfully complete assigned tasks.\n\nBias in Decision-making\n\nBiases in LLMs propagate to agents. Requires continuous monitoring and retraining.\n\nExplainability\n\nCan you trace the agent’s reasoning?\n\nMore explainability often means less flexibility.\n\n\n\nKey Insight: Evaluating agents is similar to evaluating LLMs.\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Evaluating LLM Behavior Inside Agents\n\nWhat to measure in Generative Tasks: How “good” are the Free-text responses, Accuracy when Multiple Choices are presented.\n\nWhat to measure Understanding Tasks: How good is the semantic meaning in Embeddings, How accurate is the classification.\n\nE.g.: Tool selection is like a multiple-choice problem, while generating inputs that need to be fed into a tool is a free-text problem.\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Evaluating Tool Selection and Use\nTool selection is critical for agent reliability. Use classification metrics:\n\nAccuracy: Overall correctness.\n\nPrecision:\n# times tool was correct / # times tool was selected.\nUseful when false positives are costly.\n\nRecall:\n# times tool was selected / # times tool should have been selected.\nUseful when missing a tool is costly.\n\nExample:\nLow recall → Agent often misses the right tool.\nLow precision → Agent confuses tools.\nPositional Bias Problem:\nFollowing are the tools at an LLM's disposal \n\nTool 1\nTool 2\nTool 3\nTool 4\nTool 5\n\netc\n\nPositional bias (present even in Transformer architectures) in prompts affects tool selection. Tools listed first are often over-selected.\n\nThe starting tool may be over-prioritized. Tools 4 and 5 could be ignored (low recall). Even OpenAI and Google models show this bias.\n\nPersonal Experience Anecdote from Sinan:  &gt; - Type of LLM chosen affects quality of responses and also tool selection &gt; - From experience, an AI practitioner realized it was NOT “crewAI” that sucked, but it was a small quantized model that sucked at selecting the right tool. Once changed to bigger LLMs, the same crewAI tool worked well.\n\n\n\n4.4 Assessing Response Quality\nTwo approaches:\n\nTraditional: Compare generated text with ground truth using embeddings and cosine similarity.\n\nModern: Use rubrics (like a teacher’s grading methodology) and LLM-based grading.\n\nRubric Criteria Examples:\n- How well does the answer match reference answers?\n- Is it natural, safe, and helpful?\nLLM Grading Example:\nUse GPT-4o to score answers on a scale (e.g., 1–10) for each criterion.\n\n\n\n4.5 Human vs LLM Evaluation\n\nHuman Evaluation\n\nHigh quality but expensive (e.g., Mechanical Turk).\n\nConsensus among judges is hard.\n\nLLM Evaluation\n\nCheap and scalable.\n\nRisk of bias (e.g., positional bias).\n\nMitigation: Use Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in grading prompts.\n\n\nExample Prompt for Pairwise Comparison:\n### User Question\n{question}\n\n### Assistant 1 Answer\n{answer_1}\n\n### Assistant 2 Answer\n{answer_2}\n\n### Rating Task\nRate which answer is better on a scale of 1–8.\nOutput JSON: {\"reason\": \"...\", \"score\": integer}\n\nAdding CoT improves fairness but does not fully eliminate bias.\n\n\n\n4.6 Key Takeaways for Agent Evaluation\n\nEvaluate tool selection, response quality, and bias systematically.\n\nUse classification metrics for tool use and rubrics for response quality.\n\nCombine human evaluation (for quality) with LLM evaluation (for scale).\n\nWatch out for positional bias in both tool selection and grading."

    "text": "5. Expanding on ReAct with Planning and Reflection\n\n5.1 Why Agents Fail?\nAgents often fail due to:\n\nWrong tool selection (even if previously correct)\nTool failure (e.g., invalid parameters, scraping errors)\nInfinite loops (exceeding time or step limits)\n\nDebugging Agents\n\nTest different LLMs for better tool alignment.\nHandle tool errors gracefully and allow retries.\nAdd loop limits in prompts to prevent runaway reasoning.\n\nUnderstanding ReAct Pattern\nUser Query → Thought → Action → Observation → Thought → Action → ... → Final Answer\nExample:\n\nQuery: “Who is Sinan Ozdemir?”\nThought: “Look him up”\nAction: Search\nObservation: “AI expert, author…”\nThought: “Check his site”\nAction: Visit site\nObservation: “Consults for companies”\nFinal Thought: “I have enough info to respond”\n\nPlan Ahead\n\nInstead of step-by-step reasoning, plan the entire workflow first for efficiency.\n\nFeedback Loops\n\nAdd real-time or batch feedback to improve future decisions.\n\n\n\n\n5.2 Plan & Execute Agents\n\n5.2.1 Optimizing Agents with Plan & Execute\nReplace a single LLM doing everything with:\n\nPlanner: Large LLM creates a multi-step plan.\nExecutors: Smaller, faster LLMs execute steps.\nBenefits: Faster execution, better scalability.\n\n(Planner delegates tasks like “Lookup” and “Summarize” to smaller agents.)\n\n\n\n5.2.2 How to code Plan & Execute in LangGraph | refer the notebook\n\nA. Concept and Inspiration\n\nPlan & Execute has two parts:\n\nPlanner. An LLM creates a multi‑step plan for a large task.\nExecutor. An agent executes each step with tools.\n\nInspiration: https://blog.langchain.dev/planning-agents/\n\nB. Executor: A Basic ReAct Agent\n\nTool: DuckDuckGoSearchRun\nPrompt: ih/ih-react-agent-executor from LangChain Hub\nLLM: gpt-4o-mini\nBuilder: create_react_agent(llm, tools, state_modifier=prompt)\nBehavior: Answers user queries by thinking, acting with a tool, and observing the result.\nExample query: “Who won the most recent Ravens game?”\n\nThe agent searched and returned a game summary (correct as of 11/19/24).\n\n\nC. Planner: Structured Step Generation\n\nSchema:\nclass Plan(BaseModel):\n    steps: List[str]\n\nPrompt goals:\n\nProduce a simple, step‑by‑step plan.\nInclude only necessary steps.\nEnsure each step has required info.\nLLM: gpt-4o-mini with structured output to Plan. Example plan (condensed):\n\n\nIdentify the most recent Ravens game.\nDetermine if they won.\nIf they won, find the starting QB.\nFind the QB’s hometown.\n\nD. Replanner: Update Plan or Respond\n\nModels:\nclass Response(BaseModel):\n    response: str\n\nclass Act(BaseModel):\n    action: Union[Response, Plan]\nPrompt inputs:\n\nObjective\nOriginal plan\nPast steps completed\n\nBehavior:\n\nIf enough info is available, return a final response.\nElse, return only remaining steps.\n\nLLM: gpt-4o with structured output to Act.\nExample:\n\nPast step done: “Identify the most recent game”\n\nNew plan excludes completed steps and keeps the rest.\n\n\nE. Graph Assembly in LangGraph\n\nState:\nclass PlanExecute(TypedDict):\n    input: str\n    plan: List[str]\n    past_steps: Annotated[List[Tuple], operator.add]\n    response: str\nNodes:\n\nplanner: Creates the plan from the user input.\nexecutor: Formats and executes step 1 with the ReAct agent.\nreplan: Decides to respond or refine the plan.\n\nRouting:\n\nSTART → planner → executor → replan\nConditional edge from replan:\n\nIf a final response exists → END\nElse → executor (loop)\n\n\n\nF. Running the Plan & Execute Agent\n\nInput example:\ninputs = {\"input\": \"what is the hometown of the QB of the winner of the Ravens game on 11/17/2024\"}\nfor event in app.stream(inputs):\n    for node_name, output in event.items():\n        print(f'Node: {node_name}. Output: {output}')\n\nKey Takeaways From this Jupyter Notebook\n\nPlan & Execute separates planning and action. This improves clarity.\nThe ReAct executor handles web lookups and tool calls well.\nThe replanner removes completed steps.

A digression alert: - If I take another stab at the above sample projects, I would have now used Cloudformation or Terraform, instead of AWS CLI. - But it would still be with Tasfiles for packaging those commands. For example, infra would created using aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name myteststack but this command would be inside a task create_vpc_subnet_stack"

    "text": "Conclusion\n\nWe have seen how useful taskfiles are for different types of requirements. Be it a AWS CLI or terraform script,a bash or python script, or a set of docker/K8s commands, abstract them away using easy to create and use taskfiles.\nOne more thing to note is that, environment variable values can be kept hidden in a .env (or .any_file_name for that matter.) You do not have to explicitly save them inside a git shared Taskfile.yml. This process ensures more security and replicability of the codebase across projects\n\n\nIf you think Taskfile is so useful to you, consider donating the author of this amazing Go module here.\nThis is a definitely useful tool to have in your tool box. Happy learning, everyone."

It does so by randomly(with probability 1-p) setting weights of the neural network to zero during the training phase. - Thus redressing the issue of information loss in the Recurrent Neural Network while still performing regularization.\n Source: Yashu Seth on AWD LSTM - https://yashuseth.blog/2018/09/12/awd-lstm-explanation-understanding-language-model/\nIf interested in understanding the architecture of ULMFit in-depth, checkout my notebook from 2019 here\n\n\nELMo\n\nELMo comes up with better word representations/embeddings using Language Models that learn the context of the word in focus  Ignore the hidden vectors predicting the padding tokens and only focus on the vectors that predict on the words source: https://medium.com/@plusepsilon/the-bidirectional-language-model-1f3961d1fb27\n\nELMo uses the Bi-directional Language Model to get a new embedding that will be concatenated with the initialized word embedding. The word “are” in the above figure will have a representation formed with the following embedding vectors\n\nOriginal embedding, GloVe, Word2Vec or FastText for example\nForward pass hidden layer representation vector\nBackward pass hidden layer representation vector\n\n\n\nAbout ELMo Word Vectors:\nELMo models both - (1) complex characteristics of word use (e.g., syntax and semantics) - (2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts (i.e., to model polysemy)   - ELMo word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pretraind on a large text corpus   - ELMo assigns each token/word a representation that is function of the entire input sentence   - ELMo representations are deep, in the sense that they are a function of all of the internal layers of the biLM - In other words, ELMo doesn’t just use the top LSTM layer, but all the internal layers   - higher-level LSTM states capture context-dependent aspects of word meaning - lower-level states model aspects of syntax\nELMo does well in 6 diverse NLP tasks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask\nDescription\nComments about Dataset\nEvaluation Parameter\nPrevious SOTA\nELMo SOTA\n\n\n\n\nSQuAD\nStanford Question Answering Dataset\na reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable\nF1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall)\n84.4\n85.8\n\n\nSNLI\nStanford Natural Language Inference\nSNLI corpus (version 1.0) is a collection of 570k human-written English sentence pairs manually labeled for balanced classification with the labels entailment, contradiction, and neutral, supporting the task of natural language inference (NLI), also known as recognizing textual entailment (RTE)\nAccuracy\n88.6\n88.7\n\n\nSRL\nSemantic Role Labeling\nSemantic Role Labeling (SRL) recovers the latent predicate argument structure of a sentence, providing representations that answer basic questions about sentence meaning, including “who” did “what” to “whom,” etc\nF1 Score\n81.7\n84.6\n\n\nCoref\nCoreference resolution\nCoreference resolution is the task of finding all expressions that refer to the same entity in a text.\nAverage F1\n67.2\n70.4\n\n\nNER\nNamed Entity Recognition\nThe named entity recognition model identifies named entities (people, locations, organizations, and miscellaneous) in the input text\nF1\n91.93\n92.22\n\n\nSST-5\n5-class Stanford Sentiment Treebank Dataset\nfine-grained sentiment classification task uses 5 discrete classes: Strongly positive, Weakly positive, Neutral, Weakly negative, Strongly negative\nAccuracy\n53.7\n54.7\n\n\n\n\nsources for the Task Description: - https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/ - https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/ - https://demo.allennlp.org/semantic-role-labeling/MTIzODQzNg== - https://demo.allennlp.org/coreference-resolution/MTIzODQzNA== - https://demo.allennlp.org/named-entity-recognition/MTIzODQzOA== - https://towardsdatascience.com/fine-grained-sentiment-analysis-in-python-part-1-2697bb111ed4\nPre-trained Bidirectional LM Architecture of ELMo:\n\nAdvantages of ELMo: - high-quality deep context-dependent representations are learned from biLMs - the biLM layers efficiently encode different types of syntactic and semantic information about words-in-context\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nI hope this blog gives a good understanding of the pre-transformer era history of Transfer Learning architectures in NLP\nI will cover more about BERT and Transformers in the upcoming articles"

Sometimes, for simple NER problem (like tagging only one entity like this Disease NER), even excel is good for annotation\nReferences: - https://spacy.io/api/cli#evaluate - If you would like to replicate the above results, refer to the DiseaseNER notebooks in this link"

Elements\n\nState\n\n\nState is a shared data structure\nHolds the context of the application; In other words, keeps the application’s memory\n\n\nAnalogy: Imagine a room with people starting at a whiteboard. The Participants are nodes. The Whiteboard is the state that holds the updated information\n\n# State: shared data structure\nstate = {\"counter\": 0, \"user\": \"Alice\"}\n\nNodes\n\n\nNodes are individual functions or operations that perform specific tasks within the graph\n\n\nAnalogy: Imagine a factory assembly line. Node is the function that each station in the assembly line does (such as painting, fixing, etc.,)\n\n# Node: function that performs a specific task\ndef increment_counter(state):\n    state[\"counter\"] += 1\n    return state\n\nGraph\n\n\nGraph in a LangGraph is the structure that maps out how different tasks are connected and executed.\nGraph represents the workflow showing sequence and conditional paths between various operations\n\n\nAnalogy: Graph is a like a road map interconnecting cities. You can move from 1 node to the other through different nodes in the middle.\n\n# Graph: structure mapping tasks and their connections\nnodes = {\n    \"start\": lambda state: state,\n    \"increment\": increment_counter,\n    \"end\": lambda state: state\n}\n\ngraph = [\"start\", \"increment\", \"end\"]\n\nEdges\n\n\nEdges are the connections between nodes that determine the flow of execution\nEdge dictates which node should be executed next after the current one completes its task.\n\n# Edge: connection between nodes\nedges = {\n    \"start\": \"increment\",\n    \"increment\": \"end\"\n}\n\nConditional Edges\n\n\nConditional Edges are specialized connections that decide the next node to execute based on specific conditions or logic applied to the current state.\n\n# Edge: connection between nodes\nedges = {\n    \"start\": \"increment\",\n    \"increment\": \"end\"\n}\n\nSTART and END\n\n\nThe START node is a virtual entry point in LangGraph, marking where the workflow begins. There is no operation performed here\nThe END node signifies the conclusion of the workflow in LangGraph. Upon reaching this node, the workflow is completed.\n\n# START and END nodes\ndef start_node(state):\n    print(\"Workflow begins\")\n    return state\n\ndef end_node(state):\n    print(\"Workflow completed\")\n    return state\n\nTools:\n\n\n(Sub)Functions that nodes utilize to perform specific tasks like fetch data using an API\nNodes are part of the Graph Structure. Tools are used within the nodes\n\n# 7.

ToolNode: Node that runs a tool\ndef tool_node(state, tool, *args, **kwargs):\n    result = tool(*args, **kwargs)\n    state[\"tool_result\"] = result\n    return state\n\n\n# Specific example connecting to the 7.Tools function\ndef tool_node(state, fetch_data, api_url):\n    result = fetch_data(api_url)\n    state[\"tool_result\"] = result\n    return state\n\nStateGraph:\n\n\nStateGraph is a class in LangGraph that is used to build and compile a Graph Structure. Much like a blueprint of a building\n\n# 9. StateGraph: Class to build and run a graph\nclass StateGraph:\n    def __init__(self, nodes, edges, start_node):\n        self.nodes = nodes\n        self.edges = edges\n        self.current_node = start_node\n        self.state = {}\n\n    def run(self, initial_state):\n        self.state = initial_state\n        while self.current_node != \"end\":\n            node_func = self.nodes[self.current_node]\n            self.state = node_func(self.state)\n            self.current_node = self.edges.get(self.current_node, \"end\")\n        return self.state\n\nRunnable:\n\n\nA Runnable in LangGraph is a standardized, executable component that performs a specific task within an AI workflow.\nWhile a node will typically receive a state, perform an operation and return the updated state, a runnable could mean many modular operations\nIt serves as a fundamental building block, allowing for us to create modular systems.\nMuch like Lego Blocks\n\n# 10.

It is used to build, compile, and execute the workflow, keeping track of the shared state. - A StateGraph does not necessarily comprise many Graphs; rather, it is an implementation of a graph that is state-aware.\nIs Tool Message used to pass arguments to tools? - Yes, a Tool Message is used to represent the invocation of a tool, including passing arguments and receiving results. It is similar to a Function Message but specific to tool usage.\n\n\nTo run the codes in the below sections on Graph and Agents, ensure you have setup the environment like below\n\n## Getting Started (zsh/Mac)\n\n### Using pyenv and uv\n\n#### 1.

However, based on the text, it can be inferred that the stock ticker for Apple is likely \"AAPL\", as it is commonly known and widely used.\n\nThis inference is supported by the fact that the document mentions Apple's stock price and market capitalization without specifying a ticker symbol. Additionally, the mention of Alphabet (Google) with its ticker symbol \"GOOGL\" suggests that the document uses standard ticker symbols for publicly traded companies.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, I would suggest that the ticket symbol for Apple is likely \"AAPL\".\n\nWhat is your question (type 'exit' to quit):  How did Tesla perform in the 2024 Stock market?\n\n=== ANSWER ===\nTesla performed well in the 2024 stock market, with its share price ending the year up approximately 63% (Doc 1, page 4 and Doc 2, page 4). However, the company faced volatility during the first half of 2024 due to concerns about slowing EV demand and tighter profit margins, causing shares to decline substantially from their late-2023 levels (Doc 1, page 4).\n\nThe trend reversed dramatically in the final months of 2024, with virtually all of Tesla's yearly gains coming in the fourth quarter. The stock skyrocketed after the U.S. presidential election in November 2024, bolstered by a more business-friendly administration and hopes for renewed demand and pricing power in the EV market (Doc 4, page 4). By December 2024, Tesla's stock was trading near record highs, briefly touching an all-time closing high of around $480 per share in mid-December (Doc 4, page 4).\n\nOverall, while Tesla faced challenges during the first half of 2024, its strong performance in the fourth quarter ultimately led to a significant annual gain.\n\n\nRAG Agent - WorkFlow\n\n\n\nRAG Agent - Sequence Diagram"

This way, we can learn and practice locally without external dependencies.\nLangGraph is a flexible framework. At its core, it treats AI agentic tasks as graphs/workflows, which is the foundation of its flexibility. Each node in the workflow can execute Python functions, meaning you can seamlessly integrate any agentic framework.\nHere’s an excellent example that combines LangGraph + Strands Agent + MCP:\n Source: Amazon Blog Post"

    "text": "2. Theory of Word2Vec\n\n2A. What are the two types of Word2Vec Models?\n\n1. Continuous Bag of Words:\n\nPredict focus word given bag-of-words context\n\nE.g. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\ncurrent_slide_position = 4\nfocus_word = sentence.split()[4] = “jumps”\ncontext_window_size = 2 (one of the hyperparameters)\ncontext_words = sentence.split()[4-2:4] + sentence.split()[4:4+2] = [brown, fox, over, the]\n\n\n\n\n\nTraining Data: p(jumps | brown), p(jumps | fox), p(jumps | over), p(jumps|the)\n\n\n\nHow CBOW works?\n\nContext size is one of the hyper paramaters of Word2Vec\nUsual size: 5-10 words. We can widen the context words by dropping stop words like “the”\n\nForward Propagation:  Step 1: Find the mean of the input word vectors - Compute the dot product of Weight matrix \\(W_1\\) with each of the context word vector \\(c\\) and then average the resulting word embeddings - Since we compute mean, the order of the context words does not influence the prediction (hence the bag-of-words name)\n\\[ h = {{1 \\over \\vert{C}\\vert} {\\sum \\limits_{c \\epsilon C} W_1^T c}}\\] \\[ Where\\ h\\ is\\ the\\ mean\\ of\\ the\\ input\\ context\\ word\\ embeddings \\]\n\\[ Where\\ C\\ is\\ the\\ no.\\ of\\ Context\\ Words \\]\n\\[ Where\\ c\\ is\\ the\\ one-hot\\ encoded\\ vector\\ of\\ every\\ input\\ context\\ word\\] \nStep 2: Get the output prediction - Multiply the mean word embeding \\(h\\) by the second weight matrix \\(W_2\\) and then do softmax on the product - The above operations gives the predicted probability of output word given all the context words\n\\[ p(y | C) = softmax(W_2^T h) \\]\nKey learnings from the above CBoW Equations: - Word2Vec is a linear model (there is no activation function like tanh) - To be specific, Word2Vec is a log-linear model - Since Word2Vec is linear, the training is faster than a typical NN because backpropagation through linear layer is faster than through a non-linear layer\n\n\n\n2. Skipgram:\n\nPredict context words given the focus word\n\nE.g. The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog\n\ncurrent_slide_position = 4\nfocus_word = sentence.split()[4] = “jumps”\ncontext_window_size = 2 (one of the hyperparameters)\ncontext_words = sentence.split()[4-2:4] + sentence.split()[4:4+2] = [brown, fox, over, the]\n\n\n\nSkip Gram is a like a bigram where we skip a few word positions  Image Source: NLP Udemy Course by Lazy Programmer\n\nTraining Data: p(brown | jumps), p(fox|jumps), p(over|jumps), p(the|jumps)\n\n\n\nHow Skip Gram works?\nForward Propagation:\n\\[ h = W_1^T\\ input\\_focus\\_word \\]\n\\[ p(y|input\\_focus\\_word) = softmax(W_2^T\\ h) \\]\nWhere input_focus_word = one-hot encoding of the input focus word\n\n\n\n\n2B. How is Word2Vec training optimized (objective function and optimization methods)?\n\nWhy ordinary softmax could be problematic?\nK = Vocab Size = No. of Output Classes\nSuppose a large dataset has 100,000 unique tokens as K - Large number of output classes - affect accuracy - P(output_word|focus_word) = 1/ 100,000 = 99.99999% chance of failure - Order of complexity of softmax calculation is \\(O(K)\\)\n\\[ p(y=j |x) \\ = {{e^{(w_j^T+ b_j)}} \\over \\sum \\limits_{k=1}^K {e^{(w_k^T x + b_k)}}} \\]\n\n\n\nHierarchical Softmax\n\nAn approximation to the normal softmax.\nIt uses a binary tree method to find the probability of a word being the output word\nReduces the number of classes in the denominator\nReduces the complexity from \\(O(K)\\) to \\(O(\\log_2 K)\\)\n\n\nSource: Oreilly Link\nKey points:\nThe error is propagated backwards to only those nodes that are activated at the time of prediction\n\nTo train the model, our goal is still to minimize the negative log Likelihood (since this also a softmax).\nBut instead of updating all output vectors per word, we update the vectors of the nodes in the binary tree that are in the path from root to leaf node.\n“Huffman coding” is used to construct this binary tree.\n\nFrequent words are closer to the top\nInfrequent words are closer to the bottom\n\n\n\n\n\nNegative Sampling\n\nThe basic idea is to convert a multinomial classification problem (as it is the problem of predicting the next word) to a binary classification problem.\nThat is, instead of using softmax to estimate a true probability distribution of the output word, a binary logistic regression is used instead\n\nUsual Softmax\n\nNegative Sampling Softmax\n\nFor each training sample, the classifier is fed - a true pair (a center word and another word that appears in its context) and - a number of k randomly corrupted pairs (consisting of the center word and a randomly chosen word from the vocabulary)\nBy learning to distinguish the true pairs from corrupted ones, the classifier will ultimately learn the word vectors.\n\nThis is important: instead of predicting the next word (the “standard” training technique), the optimized classifier simply predicts whether a pair of words is good or bad (which makes this a binary classification problem)\n\nA model is trained to predict whether the output word is a correct or corrupt one. ?  - Hyperparameter in Word2Vec w.r.t Negative Sampling: Number of Negative samples - Original Word2Vec paper suggests using 5-20 negative sampling words for smaller datasets, and 2-5 for large datasets\nSource: Advanced NLP Udemy Course by Lazy Programmer\n\n\n\n\n2C. How Word2vec was implemented?\n1. There is a twist in the way negative sampling logic was implemented\nExpected Method  Ex. “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”  - Word2Vec Model Type: Skipgram - Focus Word (input): jumps - Context Words (correct output/positive samples): brown, fox, over, the - Negative Samples (corrupted outputs/ negative samples): apple, orange, london, ship\nActual Method \nEx. “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”  Negative sentence = “The quick brown fox lighthouse over the lazy dog.” - Word2Vec Model Type: Skipgram - Focus Word (positive input): jumps - Negative input: lighthouse - Context Words (positive samples): Predicting brown, fox, over or the given jumps - Context Words (corrupted outputs or negative samples): Predicting brown, fox, over or the given lighthouse\n\n2. Dropping high frequency words increases context window\nEx. “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.”  New sentence = “quick brown fox jumps lazy dog.”\n\n3. Decaying Learning Rate - Decay the learning rate from max to min\n\n4. Typical Hyper Parameters used for Word2Vec model Training - no_of_epochs = 20 - context_window_size = 5 - starting_learning_rate = 0.025 - final_learning_rate = 0.0001 - (automatic calculation of learning rate decay using above two values) - Hidden layer dimension size = Word2Vec Embedding Size = 300"

    "text": "4. Conclusion\n\nYour choice of Word2Vec model depends on the below rationale\n\nSkip-gram: Works well with small amount of the training data, represents well even rare words or phrases.\nCBOW: Several times faster to train than the skip-gram, slightly better accuracy for the frequent words.\n\n\n\nWhat made Word2Vec popular? - Word2Vec was the first scalable model that generated word embeddings for large corpus (millions of unique words). - One of the first useful Transfer Learning embedding that improved accuracy of Text Classification (compared to bag of words approaches)\nWhat are the competing pre-trained embeddings? - GloVe - a Word Embedding algorithm trained using word co-occurrences - achieved similar results as Word2Vec but with less training time. However, memory foot-print needd to store co-occurrence matrix made it disadvantageous for large corpuses - Both Word2Vec and GloVe did not handle out of vocabulary (OOV) cases. All OOV words were given the same embedding. - FastText - an algorithm very similar to Word2Vec but at character level - solved the OOV issue to some extent. This is possible because FastText aggregates embeddings of individual ngrams of the word. There are more chances of presence of ngrams of a word than the whole word.\n\nThe need for more contextualized embeddings: - Polysemy is not captured. E.g.: “cell” could be “biological cell”, “prison cell” or “phone” - All above 3 algorithms sufferred with respect to polysemy. The contextualized embeddings from ELMo, ULMFiT and transformer models since BERT solved the polysemy problem better"

You save the progress of all those files via a `commit`.\n% pwd\n/some/path/to/sample_git_dir\n% echo \"file1\" &gt; file1.txt && echo \"file2\" &gt; file2.txt\n# Before you `commit`, you add your changes to a `staging` area.\n# You can add many files to the staging area.\n% git add file1.txt file2.txt\n# You save the progress of all those files via a `commit`. \n% git commit -m \"first commit\"\n# ---\n\n\n3.3 What is a HEAD?\n- HEAD is **a pointer** that refers to the \"current location\" or the \"current commit\" you are on, in your repository\n% echo \"file3\" &gt; file3.md\n% git add file3.md\n% git commit -m \"second commit\"\n# ----\n\n# note that the `HEAD` is at the commit `85de13a`\n% git log --oneline\ned71ef7 (HEAD -&gt; main) second commit\n331ee7b first commit\n\nNote that I did not say “latest commit” in the previous sentence :) Whichever commit you are currently “checking out”, that commit becomes the HEAD\nGenerally, the HEAD is on the latest commit in a branch you are working.\nYou could go to a specific commit git checkout commit-hash-or-tag. Then you would be on a detached HEAD (not to worry!). You can create a new branch from that detached HEAD position or simply go back to an existing branch.\n\n# Even if you progress further, you could go back to any specific commit\n% git checkout 331ee7b\nNote: switching to '331ee7b'.\n\nYou are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental\nchanges and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this\nstate without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.\n\nIf you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may\ndo so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:\n\n  git switch -c &lt;new-branch-name&gt;\n\nOr undo this operation with:\n\n  git switch -\n\nTurn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false\n\nHEAD is now at 331ee7b updating files of type txt\n\nWhen you are in a detached HEAD state in a particular commit, the state of files then would be shown. In other words, new files or updates created after that commit would not be visible.\n\n# the file `file3.md` was not created during this commit `7db0093`\n% ls\nfile1.txt file2.txt\n# --- \n\n# I am going from this detached HEAD state back to the `branch`\n% git status\nHEAD detached at 331ee7b\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n\nYou can always switch to any branch to come out of the detached HEAD\n\n% git checkout main\nPrevious HEAD position was 331ee7b updating files of type txt\nSwitched to branch 'main'\n\n% ls\nfile1.txt file2.txt file3.md\n\n\n3.4 Btw, what exactly is a branch?\n\nBranches are like alternate timelines! We can work on multiple tasks in parallel branches or have different branches just to simply separate the different tasks.\nEach branch in a git repo has a specific set of associated commits.\n\n# what are the branches you have now\n% git branch --list -a\n* main\n\n% git status\nOn branch main\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n\n% cat file1.txt \nfile1\n\n\n# create and switch to that branch\n% git switch -c sample_branch_1\n\n# add more contents to `file1.txt`\n% echo \"\\nMore contents here ...\" &gt;&gt; file1.txt\n% git add file1.txt && git commit -m \"third commit\"\n\nMaking changes on one branch does not affect other branches until we merge them.\n\n# what is the content of `file1.txt` in `sample_branch_1`?\n% git show sample_branch_1:file1.txt\nfile1\n\nMore contents here ...\n\n# what is the content of `file1.txt` in `main`\n% git show main:file1.txt\nfile1\n\n\nHow do I merge 2 branches?\n- Let us merge a \"feature\" branch into \"main\"\n# currently the HEAD is in `sample_branch_1` branch\n% git log --oneline --all                          \n2bf38e2 (HEAD -&gt; sample_branch_1) third commit\ned71ef7 (main) second commit\n331ee7b first commit\n\n% git status\nOn branch sample_branch_1\nnothing to commit, working tree clean\n\n% git switch main\n\n% git merge sample_branch_1\nUpdating ed71ef7..2bf38e2\nFast-forward\n file1.txt | 2 ++\n 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)\n\n# Now, let us see file1.txt again\n% git show main:file1.txt\nfile1\n\nMore contents here ...\n\n% git log --oneline\n2bf38e2 (HEAD -&gt; main, sample_branch_1) third commit\ned71ef7 second commit\n331ee7b first commit\n\n\n3.5 What is a .git directory?\nThe .git directory is essentially the heart of Git. That is what makes version control work.\nWhen you initialize a Git repository using git init, this directory is created at the root of your project. Below is an overview of the structure and contents of the .git directory:\n\nKey Components of the .git Directory\nThere are more files and directories than the below ones but I am focusing the spotlight on items I have historically noticed.\n\n1. Files\n\n.git/config A file containing repository-specific configuration\n\n% cat .git/config\n[core]\n    repositoryformatversion = 0\n    filemode = true\n    bare = false\n    logallrefupdates = true\n    ignorecase = true\n    precomposeunicode = true\n[user]\n    email = youremail@something.com\n    name = Your Name\n\n.git/HEAD - Refers to the current branch’s latest commit\n\n% cat .git/HEAD\nref: refs/heads/main\n\n.git/index - Serves as the staging area for changes, holding metadata like timestamps and filenames along with their SHA-1 hashes in binary form\n\nWhat is the difference between working directory and index terms in .git directory? - Working Directory: This is the actual directory where project files are located. Modifications made to files in the working directory are considered ‘untracked’ until explicitly staged for commit.  - Staging Area (Index): The staging area acts as an intermediate step between the working directory and the .git directory\n\nSkipping explanations for other files like ORIG_HEAD, FETCH_HEAD (you can explore here )\n\n% find .git -type f -name \"*\" -depth 1\n.git/ORIG_HEAD\n.git/config\n.git/HEAD\n.git/description\n.git/index\n.git/packed-refs\n.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG \n\n\n2. Directories\n% find .git -type d -name \"*\" -depth 1\n.git/filter-repo\n.git/objects\n.git/info\n.git/logs\n.git/hooks\n.git/refs\n\n.git/refs - This directory contains references to commits that are pointing to branches or tags\n\n% tree -L 3 .git/refs      \n.git/refs\n├── heads\n└── tags\n\n# stores the commit id where main branch is pointing to\n% cat .git/refs/heads/main\n331ee7b90c8ba8a0cdc1a2d2824198114fd82bf7\n\n% git log --oneline\n331ee7b (**main**) first commit\n\n.git/logs - Stores reference logs (hint: reflogs - git reflog ) that track changes to branch tips, aiding in recovery and auditing processes.\n\n% tree -L 3 .git/logs         \n.git/logs\n├── HEAD\n└── refs\n    └── heads\n        ├── main\n        └── sample_branch_1\n\n3 directories, 3 files\n\n.git/objects contains information about 3 types of objects stored here\n\n- Blobs (content of files),\n- Trees (directories),\n- Commits and Tags (commit metadata).\n\nWant to learn what are .git/objects hands-on? Follow the commands below.\n\n% mkdir -p git-objects-demo && cd git-objects-demo && git init\n% echo \"Hello Reader\" &gt;&gt; my_blog_reader.txt\n% git add my_blog_reader.txt && git commit -m \"first commit\"\n% tree -L 3 .git/objects \n.git/objects\n├── 27\n│   └── ce6a44f95b9e65d69a4ad7222c51a2d43d50b0\n├── 55\n│   └── 8f4283c08411bf4dca21aac74c3f0fbdd2d63f\n├── d1\n│   └── d8585ee8e0ae24a3996103b36e27c89711d57f\n├── info\n└── pack\n\n6 directories, 3 files\n% git cat-file --help\n...\ngit-cat-file - Provide content or type and size information for repository objects\n...\n\n# tree object having the directory,file name and other details\n% git cat-file -p 27ce6a44f95b9e65d69a4ad7222c51a2d43d50b0\n100644 blob d1d8585ee8e0ae24a3996103b36e27c89711d57f    my_blog_reader.txt\n\n# blob object showing raw file content\n% git cat-file -p d1d8585ee8e0ae24a3996103b36e27c89711d57f\nHello Reader\n\n# commit object showing the tree object's hash\n% git cat-file -p 558f4283c08411bf4dca21aac74c3f0fbdd2d63f\ntree 27ce6a44f95b9e65d69a4ad7222c51a2d43d50b0\nauthor Your Name &lt;your_email@something.com&gt; 1739191036 +0530\ncommitter Your Name &lt;your_email@something.com&gt; 1739191036 +0530\n\nfirst commit\n\nI am skipping explanations about .git/hooks (warrants a blog on its own about precommit hooks)\n.git/filter-repo directory helps in rewriting history.\n\nSource: Stackoverflow discussion on .git"

    "text": "5. Remote Git Learnings\n\n5.1 Remote Repositories\n\nA local repository is the Git repository stored on your local computer (whatever we have seen so far). Typical commands- git add, git commit, git log\nA remote repository is a Git repository hosted on a server (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or self-hosted). It allows multiple developers to collaborate by pushing and pulling changes. Typical commands- git push, git pull, git fetch\n\nIn this blog, we have seen git merge and git rebase but we have not done git fetch , git pull and git push. The following explanation, about push to and pull from an online repo, can hopefully put you in good stead in real-world scenarios.\n\nFor the sake of the demonstrating push and pull in local laptop, let us setup an alternate directory as a remote\n\n\nUnderlying foundation: Whether it is Local or Remote, you are working with branches\n\nHow does a pull command works?\n\n\ngit pull origin branch_name == git fetch origin branch_name && git switch branch_name && git merge origin/branch_name\nAlso, there are different strategies for git pull (essentially different merge strategies):\n\ngit pull --ff (fast forward)\ngit pull --no-ff and\ngit pull --rebase.\n\nAll of the above different merge strategies had been dealt with in the previous section.\nWhy git pull --ff-only is a safe option: link\n\nHow does a push command work?\n\n\nWhen you do git push origin branch_name, the following commands happen:\n\ngit reverse-fetch branch_name (this is a fictional command of my own that just indicates the contents of branch_name are pushed to remote server)\nIn the remote_server, you would switch to the origin/branch_name git switch origin/branch_name\nIn the remote_server, you would merge the new changes from branch_name with origin_branch_name\n\n\n\n\nPutting above learnings to practice.\nDid I not say Whether it is Local or Remote, you are working with branches? Let me prove that in an example below\n\n\n% mkdir -p remote_learnings\n\n# `remote_learnings` 1s an empty directory\nremote_learnings % ls\n\n# create 3 sub directories to help in learning `clone`, `push`, `fetch` and `pull` commands\nremote_learnings % mkdir -p local_server_1 local_server_2 remote_server\n\n\n# create a local git repo in `local_server_1` directory\nremote_learnings % cd local_server_1\nremote_learnings/local_server_1 % mkdir -p fav_books && cd fav_books\n\n# create a file `harry_potters_series.txt ` and list down the names of the books\nremote_learnings/local_server_1/fav_books % vi harry_potters_series.txt \n\nremote_learnings/local_server_1/fav_books % cat harry_potters_series.txt\nHarry Potter and the Philospher\\'s Stone: The first book in the series \nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: The second book in the series \nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: The third book in the series \nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: The fourth book in the series \nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix: The fifth book in the series \nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: The sixth book in the series \nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: The seventh and final book in the series \n\nremote_learnings/local_server_1/fav_books % git add harry_potters_series.txt && git commit -m \"first commit - hp series\"\n\n# Status so far\n% tree -L 3 /path/to/remote_learnings/\n.\n├── local_server_1\n│   └── fav_books\n│       └── harry_potters_series.txt\n├── local_server_2\n└── remote_server\n\n# creare a \"bare\" git repo in `remote_server`\nremote_learnings/local_server_1/fav_books % cd $PWD/../../remote_server\nremote_learnings/remote_server % mkdir -p fav_books\nremote_learnings/remote_server/fav_books % git init --bare\n\n# now back to `local_server_1`\nremote_learnings/remote_server % cd ../local_server_1/fav_books\n# add `remote_server` directory as a remote\nremote_learnings/local_server_1/fav_books % git add remote remote_server $PWD/../../remote_server/fav_books\n\n# check if the remote is added properly\nremote_learnings/local_server_1/fav_books % cat .git/config\n[core]\n    repositoryformatversion = 0\n    filemode = true\n    bare = false\n    logallrefupdates = true\n    ignorecase = true\n    precomposeunicode = true\n[remote \"remote_server\"]\n    url = /path/to/remote_learnings/local_server_1/fav_books/../../remote_server/fav_books\n    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/remote_server/*\n \n\n# now you can \"push\" from `local_server_1` to `remote_server`\nremote_learnings/local_server_1/fav_books % git push remote_server main \n\nEnumerating objects: 3, done.\nCounting objects: 100% (3/3), done.\nDelta compression using up to 8 threads\nCompressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.\nWriting objects: 100% (3/3), 424 bytes | 424.00 KiB/s, done.\nTotal 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0\nTo /path/to/remote_learnings/local_server_1/fav_books/../../remote_server/fav_books\n * [new branch]      main -&gt; main\n\n\n# OPTIONAL STEPS\n# you could go to `remote_server` to check if the files are present\n# but remember we created a `bare` remote repo\nremote_learnings/local_server_1/fav_books % cd $PWD/../../remote_server/fav_books\nremote_learnings/remote_server/fav_books % ls \nHEAD        config      description hooks       info        objects     refs\nremote_learnings/remote_server/fav_books % cd objects \nremote_learnings/remote_server/fav_books/objects % tree -L 3 .                                             \n.\n├── 7e\n│   └── e6ec54038f2ba0dce7966a14cf010b5a994f8f\n├── be\n│   └── dbfe43f6aef154a2024eb05a91277b1455f727\n├── e0\n│   └── 30127f29099ccabe62eea5d929efc655149dff\n├── info\n└── pack\n\n\n# note how I am opening files using `git cat-file -p`\n# and now `7e` and `e6ec54038f2ba0dce7966a14cf010b5a994f8f` are clubbed together\n\nremote_learnings/remote_server/fav_books/objects %  git cat-file -p 7ee6ec54038f2ba0dce7966a14cf010b5a994f8f\nHarry Potter and the Philospher\\'s Stone: The first book in the series \nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: The second book in the series \nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: The third book in the series \nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: The fourth book in the series \nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix: The fifth book in the series \nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: The sixth book in the series \nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: The seventh and final book in the series \n\nremote_learnings/remote_server/objects % cd ../local_server_1/fav_books\n# END OF OPTIONAL STEPS\n\n# Current status\nremote_learnings/local_server_1/fav_books % git log --oneline \nbedbfe4 (HEAD -&gt; main, remote_server/main) first commit - hp series\n# What if I made a mistake?

Also, I want the API gateway path to have the same name as the lambda function\n\n\n🤖 \nThe ${ServerlessRestApi} is a CloudFormation intrinsic variable that AWS SAM automatically generates when you define an AWS::Serverless::Function with an event of type Api. It refers to the logical ID of the API Gateway RestApi resource that is created by AWS SAM.\n\nTo have the API Gateway path the same as the Lambda function name, you can modify the Path property under Events in the SAM template. Here's how you can do it:\n\n\nEvents:\n  SimpleRegexApi:\n    Type: Api\n    Properties:\n      Path: /simple_regex_lambda\n      Method: post\n\n\n\n\nQuery 5 - Correcting the SAM Template\n\n👨\nShould the Method be post or put in the API Gateway? We are passing two parameters text and regex_pattern to the lambda. I want them to be passed them in query in the API.\n\n\n🤖 \nIf you want to pass parameters via the query string, then you should use the GET method. The POST and PUT methods are typically used when you want to send data in the body of the request, not in the query string.\n\nHere's how you can modify the Method property under Events in the SAM template:\n\nEvents:\n  SimpleRegexApi:\n    Type: Api\n    Properties:\n      Path: /simple_regex_lambda\n      Method: get\n\nNow, the API Gateway will have a GET method at the /simple_regex_lambda path. You can pass parameters to the Lambda function via the query string like this: /simple_regex_lambda?text=your_text&regex_pattern=your_pattern. \n\n\n\n\nQuery 6 - Editing the Python Lambda function based on the API path\n\n👨\nIf the API pattern is like /simple_regex_lambda?text=your_text&regex_pattern=your_pattern , \nhow should the event in lambda_function.lambda_handler(event,context) be read inside the lambda function\n\n\n🤖 \nWhen you pass parameters via the query string in an API Gateway request, they are included in the event dictionary that is passed to the Lambda function. They are located under the queryStringParameters key.\n\nHere is how you can modify the lambda_handler function to read the text and regex_pattern parameters from the event dictionary:\nimport re\n\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n    parameters = event['queryStringParameters']\n    text = parameters['text']\n    regex_pattern = parameters['regex_pattern']\n    \n    match = re.search(regex_pattern, text)\n    \n    if match:\n        return match.group()\n    else:\n        return \"No Match\"\nThis function extracts the text and regex_pattern parameters from the queryStringParameters key of the event dictionary. It then uses these parameters to perform the regex search."

Allow me to explicitly pass AWS_ACCOUNT_ID and REGION (I may want to deploy it multiple regions or accounts).\n\n\n🤖 \nTo deploy your AWS SAM application, you can use the sam deploy command. Here's an example command that allows you to explicitly pass the AWS account ID and region:\nAWS_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id\nREGION=your_region\nSTACK_NAME=your_stack_name\nS3_BUCKET=your_s3_bucket\n\nsam build --use-container\n\nsam package \\\n  --output-template-file packaged.yaml \\\n  --s3-bucket $S3_BUCKET \\\n  --region $REGION\n\nsam deploy \\\n  --template-file packaged.yaml \\\n  --stack-name $STACK_NAME \\\n  --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \\\n  --region $REGION\nReplace your_account_id, your_region, your_stack_name, and your_s3_bucket with your actual AWS account ID, the region where you want to deploy the application, the name you want to give to the CloudFormation stack, and the S3 bucket where you want to upload your application code, respectively.\n\nThe sam build command builds your application and prepares it for deployment. The sam package command uploads your application code to an S3 bucket and produces a packaged AWS SAM template. The sam deploy command deploys your application using the packaged template.\n\nPlease ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform these operations in the specified AWS account and region.\n\n\n\n\nQuery 12 - What is the use of sam package command\n\n👨\nWhat is the use of sam package for simple lambda_function.py ? Can I avoid uploading the code to S3 and directly deploy in to the lambda function? Or is this a best practice?\n\n\n🤖 \nThe sam package command is used to package an AWS SAM application. It creates a .zip file of your code and dependencies, and uploads them to an S3 bucket. It also returns a copy of your AWS SAM template, replacing references to local artifacts with the Amazon S3 location where the command uploaded the artifacts.\n\nFor simple Lambda functions, you might not need to use the sam package command. You can use the AWS CLI's aws lambda update-function-code command to upload your code directly from your local machine to the Lambda function.\n\nHowever, using sam package and sam deploy is considered a best practice for a few reasons:\n\nConsistency: Whether your application is simple or complex, the process to package and deploy it remains the same. This can make it easier to manage and automate deployments.\n\nVersioning: When you upload your code to an S3 bucket, you have a centralized place to manage and version your code. This can make it easier to roll back deployments, share code across multiple environments, and track changes over time.\n\nIntegration with AWS SAM and AWS CloudFormation: The sam package and sam deploy commands are designed to work seamlessly with AWS SAM and AWS CloudFormation. This means you can define your application's resources, permissions, and event sources in a single AWS SAM template, and AWS SAM will handle the rest.\n\nLarge applications: If your application's deployment package is larger than 50 MB, you must upload it to an S3 bucket. The sam package command handles this for you.\n\nSo, while it's possible to avoid using sam package for simple applications, it's generally a good idea to use it for the reasons listed above.\n\n\n\n\nQuery 13 - Which files go inside SAM package\n\n👨\nAre both lambda_function.py and authorizer_handler.py packaged in the sam package command?\n\n\n🤖 \nYes, the sam package command packages all the AWS Lambda functions defined in your AWS SAM template, including their code and any dependencies.\n\nIn your case, if both lambda_function.py and authorizer_handler.py are referenced in your template.yaml file as handlers for different AWS Lambda functions, then both will be included in the package that sam package creates.\n\nThe command zips up each function's code and dependencies separately, uploads them to the specified S3 bucket, and then modifies the template to point to the new location of the code in S3. This packaged template is what you then deploy with the sam deploy command.\n\n\n\n\nQuery 14 - Checking if all files are present for template.yaml\n\n👨\nI have selected the template.yaml file and I am giving below the all the files inside the current directory. Is everything needed for the template.yaml present in this folder?\n\nsimple_python_lambda_via_sam_copilot_attempt \n├── authorizer_handler.py \n├── copilot_interactions.md \n├── lambda_function.py \n└── template.yaml\n\n\n🤖 \nBased on the template.yaml file and the directory structure you've provided, it seems like you have all the necessary files for your AWS SAM application.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\ntemplate.yaml: This is your AWS SAM template that describes your serverless application.\n\nauthorizer_handler.py: This is the Python file that contains the code for your Lambda authorizer function. In your template.yaml, this is referenced in the Handler property of the SimpleRegexLambdaAuthorizer resource.\n\nlambda_function.py: This is the Python file that contains the code for your main Lambda function. In your template.yaml, this is referenced in the Handler property of the SimpleRegexLambda resource.\n\ncopilot_interactions.md: This file doesn't seem to be directly related to your AWS SAM application. It might contain documentation or notes.\n\nSo, it looks like you have everything you need to package and deploy your AWS SAM application. Make sure that the lambda_handler function is defined in both authorizer_handler.py and lambda_function.py, as these are the entry points for your Lambda functions.\n\n\n\n\nQuery 15 - What does sam build --use-container do\n\n👨\nwhat does sam build --use-container do?\n\n\n🤖 \nThe sam build --use-container command is used to build your AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) application.\n\nHere's what it does:\n\nIt creates a deployment package of your application's code and any dependencies. The deployment package is a .zip file that contains your code and any dependencies. The deployment package is what AWS Lambda uses to run your application.\n\nThe --use-container option tells SAM to build your application inside a Docker container. This can be useful if your application has native dependencies that need to be compiled on the same type of operating system as the one where your Lambda function will run. By using a Docker container, you can ensure that your application is built in an environment that's similar to the AWS Lambda environment.\n\nThe command creates a new directory, .aws-sam/build, where it places the deployment packages and updated AWS SAM template.\n\nSo, in summary, sam build --use-container prepares your AWS SAM application for deployment by creating deployment packages of your code and dependencies. It does this inside a Docker container to ensure compatibility with the AWS Lambda environment.\n\n\n\n\nQuery 16 - How to test locally using SAM\n\n👨\nTo invoke your AWS SAM application locally, you can use the sam local start-api command. This command starts a local instance of API Gateway and invokes your Lambda function when you send a request to the local endpoint.\n\n\n🤖 \nHere's how you can start your local API:\nsam build --use-container\nsam local start-api\nOnce your local API is running, you can use curl to send a request to it. Assuming your API has a GET method at the /simple_regex_lambda path, here's how you can send a request:\n\ncurl http://127.0.0.1:3000/simple_regex_lambda\n\nPlease note that you need Docker running on your machine to use sam local start-api, as it runs your Lambda function inside a Docker container that replicates the AWS Lambda environment.\n\nAlso, if your Lambda function requires an Authorization header, you can include it in your curl command like this:\n\ncurl -H \"Authorization: your_password\" http://127.0.0.1:3000/simple_regex_lambda\n\n\n\n\nQuery 17 - How to use Curl command with an upload\n\n👨\nCan you provide me the complete curl command where I upload a test_event.json like below. The authorization password is out_test_password\n\n{\n    \"text\": \"Hello, my name is Senthil Kumar. I work as a software engineer at XYZ. my email id is senthil_kumar@gmail.com. Reach me at mobile +91 9876541230\",\n    \"regex_pattern\": \"(\\w+)[-_.]?(\\w+)@((\\w|-)+)\\.\\w+\"\n}\n\n\n🤖 \nSure, you can use the curl command with the -d option to send a POST request with the JSON data in test_event.json. Assuming your local API has a POST method at the /simple_regex_lambda path, here's how you can send a request:\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Authorization: out_test_password\" -d @test_event.json http://127.0.0.1:3000/simple_regex_lambda\nThis command does the following:\n\n-X POST specifies that this is a POST request.\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" sets the Content-Type header to application/json, indicating that the request body contains JSON data.\n-H \"Authorization: out_test_password\" sets the Authorization header to out_test_password.\n-d @test_event.json sends the data in test_event.json as the request body.\nhttp://127.0.0.1:3000/simple_regex_lambda is the URL of your local API.\nPlease replace test_event.json with the actual path to your JSON file if it's not in the same directory where you're running the curl command. Also, make sure your local API is running by executing the sam local start-api command.\n\n\n\n\nQuery 18 - Suggesting edits to the Curl Command\n\n👨\nHow will this command work? \n\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Authorization: out_test_password\" -d @test_event.json http://127.0.0.1:3000/simple_regex_lambda\n\nI am expecting some thing like below inside the lambda_function.py \ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n    parameters = event['queryStringParameters']\n    text = parameters['text']\n    regex_pattern = parameters['regex_pattern']\n\n\n🤖 \nThe curl command you provided sends a POST request to your local API with the JSON data in test_event.json as the request body. However, the lambda_handler function in your lambda_function.py file is expecting the text and regex_pattern parameters to be in the queryStringParameters field of the event object.\n\nWhen you send a POST request, the data in the request body is typically available in the body field of the event object, not the queryStringParameters field. The queryStringParameters field is used for query string parameters in a GET request.\n\nHere's how you can modify your lambda_handler function to handle a POST request:\nimport json\n\ndef lambda_handler(event, context):\n    body = json.loads(event['body'])\n    text = body['text']\n    regex_pattern = body['regex_pattern']\n    # rest of your code\n\nIn this modified version of the function, json.loads(event['body']) is used to parse the JSON data in the request body. Then, the text and regex_pattern parameters are extracted from the parsed JSON data."

Fixing Errors that arose\n\nQuery 20 - Error in sam build command\n\n👨\nI faced below error when trying to use `sam build --use-container`\nStarting Build inside a container\n\nError: [InvalidResourceException('SimpleRegexLambda', 'property Architecture not defined for resource of type AWS::Serverless::Function'), InvalidResourceException('SimpleRegexLambdaAuthorizer', 'property Architecture not defined for resource of type AWS::Serverless::Function')] ('SimpleRegexLambda', 'property Architecture not defined for resource of type AWS::Serverless::Function') ('SimpleRegexLambdaAuthorizer', 'property Architecture not defined for resource of type AWS::Serverless::Function')\n\nThe error message indicates that the Architecture property is not recognized for the AWS::Serverless::Function resource type. This property is used to specify the instruction set architecture for the AWS Lambda function.\n\nAs of AWS SAM version 1.27.0, the Architecture property is supported and can be set to x86_64 or arm64. If you're using an older version of AWS SAM, this property is not supported and you'll get an error if you try to use it.\n\nYou can check your AWS SAM version by running sam --version in your terminal. If you're using an older version, you can update AWS SAM with the following command:\n\nAfter updating AWS SAM, try running sam build --use-container again. If you're still getting the error, please remove the Architecture property from your AWS SAM template if you don't need to use the arm64 architecture. If you need to use the arm64 architecture, make sure you're using AWS SAM version 1.27.0 or later.\n\nThe above was an error from CoPilot.

Reach me at mobile +91 9876541230\", \"regex_pattern\": \"(\\w+)[-_.]?(\\w+)@((\\w|-)+).\\w+\" }\nThe issue you're encountering is due to the backslashes in your regular expression. In JSON, the backslash (\\) is an escape character, which means it's used to introduce special character sequences. If you want to include an actual backslash in your JSON data, you need to escape it by using two backslashes (\\\\).\n\nHere's how your JSON data should look:\n{\n    \"text\": \"Hello, my name is Senthil Kumar.

Event with id [SimpleRegexApi] is invalid. Unable to set Authorizer [SimpleRegexLambdaAuthorizer] on API method [post] for path [/simple_regex_lambda] because the related API does not define any Authorizers.\n\n\n🤖 \nThe error message indicates that the SimpleRegexApi event in the SimpleRegexLambda function is trying to use an authorizer (SimpleRegexLambdaAuthorizer), but the related API does not define any authorizers.\n\nIn AWS SAM, authorizers are defined at the AWS::Serverless::Api level, not at the individual event level within a AWS::Serverless::Function.\n\nTo fix this issue, you need to define an AWS::Serverless::Api resource in your template and specify the authorizer there. Here's an example:\n\n\nThe SimpleRegexApi should be a separate resource at the same level as SimpleRegexLambda, not nested under it. Here's an example of how your AWS SAM template should look:\nResources:\n  SimpleRegexLambda:\n    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function\n    Properties:\n      # ...\n\n  SimpleRegexLambdaAuthorizer:\n    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function\n    Properties:\n      # ...\n\n  SimpleRegexApi:\n    Type: AWS::Serverless::Api\n    Properties:\n      StageName: Prod\n      Auth:\n        DefaultAuthorizer: SimpleRegexLambdaAuthorizer\n        Authorizers:\n          SimpleRegexLambdaAuthorizer:\n            FunctionArn: !GetAtt SimpleRegexLambdaAuthorizer.Arn\n      DefinitionBody:\n        paths:\n          /simple_regex_lambda:\n            post:\n              x-amazon-apigateway-integration:\n                httpMethod: POST\n                type: aws_proxy\n                uri: \n                  Fn::Sub: arn:aws:apigateway:${AWS::Region}:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/${SimpleRegexLambda.Arn}/invocations\nIn this example, SimpleRegexLambda, SimpleRegexLambdaAuthorizer, and SimpleRegexApi are all separate resources defined at the same level under the Resources section of the AWS SAM template.\n\nPlease replace the # ... with the actual properties for your Lambda functions and API.\n\nAfter updating your AWS SAM template, try running the sam deploy command again.

About LDA\n\nLatent: \n\nTopic structures in a document are latent/hidden in the text\n\nDirichlet: \n\nThe Dirichlet distribution determines the mixture proportions of  - the topics in the documents and - the words in each topic.\n\nAllocation: \n\nAllocation of words to a given topic and allocation of topics to a document\n\n\n\nIIIA. Intuitive understanding of Dirichlet Distribution\n\nA Normal/Gaussian distribution is a continuous probability distribution over all the real numbers\n\nIt is described by a mean and a variance.\n\n\n\n\nA Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval\n\n\n\nThe Poisson distribution is specified by one parameter: lambda (λ). As lambda increases to sufficiently large values, the normal distribution (λ, λ) may be used to approximate the Poisson distribution Source:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution\n\n\n\nNow, what is Dirichlet Distribution? \n\nThe dirichlet distribution is a probability distribution as well\nbut it is not sampling from the space of real numbers. Instead it is sampling over a probability simplex \n\n\n (0.6, 0.4)\n (0.1, 0.1, 0.8)\n (0.05, 0.2, 0.15, 0.1, 0.3, 0.2)\n\n\nHow Dirichlet Distribution varies w.r.t dirichlet prior: \n\nThe below image shows Dir(α) \nAs α increases from 0.05 (1/20) to 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 respectively in plots from left to right & top to down, you can see the distribution becoming more uniform.  \n\n\n\n\nIIIB. How LDA Works?\n\nLDA is a generative model \nLDA processes documents as ‘bag of words’ – ordering of words is not important\n\n\nIn principle, LDA generates a document based on dirichlet distribution (dd) of topics over documents and dd of words over topics\n\n \nBut we inverse the generative process for statistical inference\n\n\n\nIIIC.

    "text": "III. Real-World Bedrock Architectures\nWith the API landscape clear, the natural next question is:\n\n“How do these pieces come together in real applications?”\n\nIn practice, most Bedrock-based systems fall into a small number of repeatable architectural patterns, depending on:\n\nwhether state is required\nwho owns orchestration\nhow much control vs convenience is desired\nlatency and cost sensitivity\n\nBelow are the most common patterns seen in production.\n\n\na) Stateless Batch LLM Calls (Offline / Async workloads)\nWhen to use: * High-volume, independent prompts; throughput/cost optimized; results can land later\nArchitecture\nS3 (JSONL inputs)\n   │\n   ▼\nbedrock.create-model-invocation-job\n   │\n   ▼\nS3 (JSONL outputs)\nState lives in * S3 input/output + job metadata (jobArn/status). No conversational/session state\n\n\n\nb) Stateless Online LLM Calls (Synchronous inference)\nWhen to use: * Single-turn transformations, classification, summarization, simple chat without tools/memory.\nArchitecture\nUser / App\n   │\n   ▼\nbedrock-runtime.invoke-model\nor\nbedrock-runtime.converse\n   │\n   ▼\nResponse\nState lives in * Fully stateless. All context must be sent each call.\n\n\n\nc) Managed RAG — retrieve-and-generate (Single-shot, no agent)\nThis is the simplest possible RAG that Bedrock offers.\nWhen to use * Fast “KB Q&A” with minimal plumbing; a single managed retrieval + answer step is sufficient.\nArchitecture\nUser\n  → bedrock-agent-runtime.retrieve-and-generate\n       ├─ Vector search (once)\n       ├─ Prompt assembly (retrieved result added to user prompt - bedrock-managed)\n       └─ LLM generation (non-streaming)\n  → Response\nState lives in:\n\nPrimary knowledge in the Knowledge Base (managed by Bedrock KB service).\nOne can use “sessionId” to simulate conversational continuity (where messages are appended)\n\n\n\n\nd) Self-orchestrated RAG (Application-managed)\nThis is the most common “serious production” pattern today.\nWhen to use\n\nNeed deterministic control over chunking, filtering, ordering, prompt construction, retries.\n\nArchitecture\nUser\n  → bedrock-agent-runtime.retrieve      (KB search, once)\n  → App-side trimming / filtering\n  → bedrock-runtime.ConverseStream      (LLM + streaming)\n  → Token stream → UI\nKey characteristics\n\nUses two data planes:\n\nbedrock-agent-runtime.retrieve → vector search only\nbedrock-runtime → LLM inference\n\nRetrieval and generation are decoupled\n\nState lives in: * Application-managed (retrieval results, prompt assembly, chat history, caching).\n\nThis is RAG without agents — simple, explicit, and production-friendly.\n\n\n\n\ne) Managed Agentic RAG (Bedrock-orchestrated)\nWhen to use * Need built-in planning + tool use + KB integration + traceability with fastest time-to-value.\nArchitecture\nUser\n  → bedrock-agent-runtime.invoke-agent\n       ├─ Agent orchestrates KB + tools\n       ├─ May retrieve multiple times\n       └─ Event stream (answer + trace)\n  → UI\n\nControl: bedrock-agent → configure agent (instructions, action groups, KBs)\nRun: bedrock-agent-runtime (data) → invoke-agent (answer + optional trace)\n\nState lives in: * Agent session context is tied to sessionId and can be shaped via SessionState (session attributes, conversation history, etc.).\nKey characteristics\n\nUses bedrock-agent-runtime.invoke-agent\nBedrock owns:\n\nplanning\nretrieval count\ntool invocation\nconversational state\n\nYou receive:\n\nfinal answer\noptional reasoning / trace events\n\n\nImportant nuance\n\nYou cannot control how many retrievals happen\nLatency can vary per request\nDebugging requires reading traces, not logs\n\nThis is ideal when you want capabilities, not plumbing.\n\n\n\nf) AgentCore (custom agent runtime; application-managed planner)\nFor completeness, it’s worth positioning where AgentCore fits relative to the above.\nWhen to use\n\nNeed custom agent planners (LangGraph/Strands/custom loops), long-running sessions, strict isolation, custom toolchains.\n\nArchitecture\nUser\n  → bedrock-agentcore.invoke-agent-runtime\n       ├─ Your planner loop (using LangGraph or others)\n       ├─ Explicit memory read/write\n       ├─ Tool calls (Browser / APIs / Code)\n       └─ Streaming output\n  → UI\n\nControl: bedrock-agentcore-control → deploy runtime/memory/gateway\nRun: bedrock-agentcore (data) → invoke-agent-runtime (session-based)\n\nThis is maximum control, at the cost of maximum responsibility.\n\n\n\ng) Bedrock Agents + MCP-backed tools (hybrid)\nArchitecture:\nUser\n  → 1. bedrock-agent-runtime.invoke-agent & its 3 Roles\n       ├─ (1) Agent reasoning + orchestration\n       ├─ (2) KB retrieval\n       ├─ (3) Tool selection (and infer the args for the tools)\n       → 2. OpenAPI Tool Schema gives tools context to Agent\n            → 3. Tool Adapter Lambda (MCP Client)\n                 - Converts `Bedrock Action Group Event` to tool selected + args\n                 → 4. Hits the MCP Server URL (tool) with the args\n                    - Invokes the tool (such as a DB)\n                    - Tool Result sent back to MCP Client                        \n              ← 5. MCP Client receives response (structured tool result)\n        ← 6. Tool result returned to the agent via the MCP Client\n   ← 7. Agent continues reasoning with tool result \n  ← 8. Final response (streamed to user chunk-by-chunk)\n\nWhen to use - When you need your existing Bedrock Agent to connect to MCP compatible servers - When you are ok doing some custom plumbing activities\nState lives in: * Reasoning/session context in Bedrock Agent via sessionId/SessionState. * Tool-side state in external MCP services\n\n\n\nh) Bedrock Flows (deterministic workflow orchestration)\n\n\nDeclarative, managed orchestration for predictable GenAI workflows\n\n\nArchitecture:\nUser / App\n  → bedrock-flow-runtime.invoke-flow\n       ├─ Step 1: Prompt / Model call\n       ├─ Step 2: Conditional logic\n       ├─ Step 3: Retrieval or transform\n       ├─ Step 4: Another model call\n       └─ Step N: Final response\nWhen to use * Need a governed, versioned, deterministic pipeline (branching/conditions/iterations) without writing orchestration code.\nState Lives In * Flow execution state is tracked by executionId (provided or generated) and traces can be enabled per run.\n\n\n\nMental Model Recap\n\nStateless Batch (offline) → bedrock.create-model-invocation-job\nStateless Online LLM calls → bedrock-runtime.invoke-model / bedrock-runtime.converse\nManaged RAG (single primitive) → bedrock-agent-runtime.retrieve-and-generate\nSelf-orchestrated RAG → bedrock-agent-runtime.retrieve + bedrock-runtime.converse (or bedrock-runtime.converse-stream for streaming)\nDeterministic workflows (Flows) → bedrock-agent-runtime.invoke-flow\nManaged agentic orchestration (Agents) → bedrock-agent-runtime.invoke-agent\nCustom agent runtime (AgentCore) → bedrock-agentcore.invoke-agent-runtime\nAgents + MCP-backed tools (Hybrid) → bedrock-agent-runtime.invoke-agent + external MCP tool runtime\n\nEach layer trades control for convenience — not capability."

For key protections—especially prompt‑injection and jailbreak defenses—Guardrails evaluate content inside &lt;input&gt; … &lt;/input&gt;. Explicitly tagging untrusted text clarifies what must be scrutinized.\n\nRationale (Trust Zones)\nPrompts typically mix trusted and untrusted content:\n\nTrusted: system instructions, developer rules, few‑shot examples, policy text\nUntrusted: end‑user input (free‑form text)\n\nTreating these equally risks false positives and brittle prompts. The &lt;input&gt; tag declares the untrusted region, enabling precise checks without interfering with system guidance or examples.\nExample\nWithout tags (ambiguous trust):\nSystem: You are a helpful assistant.\nUser says: how can I make a bomb?\nEvaluation may not reliably isolate the untrusted piece.\nWith tags (correct scoping):\nSystem: Follow safety rules.\n\n&lt;input&gt;\nhow can I make a bomb?\n&lt;/input&gt;\nThe model can apply injection detection and safety filtering to the tagged segment and block or rewrite as required.\nImportant Nuance\nIf a prompt omits &lt;input&gt; tags, some checks may still apply to the whole prompt, but that blurs trust boundaries: system instructions or few‑shot examples can be inadvertently filtered or altered. For prompt‑attack filters in particular, &lt;input&gt; tags are required for proper operation.\nPractical Template\nKeep trusted guidance outside; place untrusted text inside the tag.\nSystem: Customer support assistant. Follow policy strictly.\nInstructions:\n- Be concise\n- No medical or legal advice\n\n&lt;input&gt;\n{{user_message}}\n&lt;/input&gt;\nBottom Line\n\nGuardrails are scope‑aware, not blanket filters.\nTag untrusted input with &lt;input&gt; to enable accurate, robust protection.\nPreserve system/developer instructions outside the tagged region to avoid unintended filtering."

The sentences in a batch are connnected together and saved with their offsets array - Instead of each word being represented by an embedding vector, each sentence is embedded into a embedding vector - This above process of “computing a single vector for an entire sentence” is possible also from nn.Embedding followed by torch.mean(dim=1) or torch.sum(dim=1) or torch.max(dim=1)\nSo, when to use nn.EmbeddingBag? - nn.EmbeddingBag works better when sequential information of words is not needed. - Hence can be used with simple Feed forward NN and not with LSTMs or Transformers (all the embedded words are sent at once and they are sequentially processed either from both directions or unidirectional)\nSources:  - nn.EmbeddingBag vs nn.Embedding | link - nn.Emedding followed by torch.mean(dim=1) | link"

Context-prediction based Pre-trained Language Models\n\nSources:  - Advanced NLP and Deep Learning course on Udemy (by LazyProgrammer) - Idea: http://www.marekrei.com/blog/dont-count-predict/\n\n\n\n2C. LSTM-based Pre-trained Language Models\n\nEvolution of RNN Architecture till LSTM\nWhy RNNs came into existence?  - Models such as the Multi-layer Perceptron Network, vector machines and logistic regression did not perform well on sequence modelling tasks (e.g.: text_sequence2sentiment_classification) - Why? Lack of memory element ; No information retention - RNNs attempted to redress this shortcoming by introducing loops within the network, thus allowing the retention of information.\n\n\n\nAn un-rolled RNN Cell\n\n\nAdvantage of a vanilla RNN:  - Better than traditional ML algos in retaining information\nLimitations of a vanilla RNN:  - RNNs fail to model long term dependencies. - the information was often “forgotten” after the unit activations were multiplied several times by small numbers - Vanishing gradient and exploding gradient problems\nLong Short Term Memory (LSTM):  - A special type of RNN architecture - Designed to keep information retained for extended number of timesteps\nAdvantage of a LSTM:  - Better equipped for long range dependencies - Resists better than RNNs for vanishing gradient problem\nLimitations of LSTM:  - Added gates lead to more computation requirement and LSTMs tend to be slower - Difficult to train - Transfer Learning never really worked - Very long gradient paths. LSTM on 100-word doc has gradients 100-layer network\n\n\n\nSeq2Seq Models - A higher form of LMs\n\n\n\n\nThe ImageNet moment in NLP; advent of LSTM models ULMFiT and ELMo\n\nELMo comes up with better word representations/embeddings using Language Models that learn the context of the word in focus \n\n\n\n\n\n2D. Transformer-based Pre-trained Language Models\n\nLSTM Seq2Seq Model with Attention\n\n\n\n\nTransformer - A Seq2Seq Model with Attention\nTransformer: - It is a sequence model forgoes the recurrent structure of RNN to adopt attention-based approach - In other words, Transformer is an attention Model without Recurrent LSTMs\nTransformer vs LSTM - Recurrent Structure: Processes all input elements SEQUENTIALLY - Attention-based Approach: Process all input elements SIMULTANEOUSLY\n\nThe BERT Mountain by Chris McCormick: \n\n\nTransformer for a Seq2Seq Task like Machine Translation: \n\n\n\n\nThe Advent of BERT and similar Transformers\n\nWhat has been the trend of recent Pre-trained Tranformer-based LMs?\n\nExponentially increasing model complexity (number of parameters)\n\n\n\nExponentially increasing data\n\n\nQuestion to ponder: - Are models bettering in performance because of more data or more model complexity? How much is the contribution from each? - Are models built with efficiency in mind? (not a lot can replicate these models given the large number of GPUs necessary)\n\n\n\nWhat direction should future Pre-trained Transformer-based LMs go?\n\nComputational Compexity is quadratic compared to input length. We curb input length to 512 tokens for most transformer models. &gt; Better model architectures are needed to capture long-range information\nAs models become bigger and complex, their explainability becomes difficult\nThere are models/methods/explaining the workings of attention mechanism but much more is needed in this space &gt; Need more efficient models with explainability in mind as well"

    "text": "I.Introduction\n\nI.A. Why Bash Scripting\nEveryone of us deals with files and directories. We search/move/delete/copy files. We look for a particular file or directory. We may even want to search a word/phrase in the files. With Bash, we can do those tasks at scale and at great speed.\n\n\nI.B. Why Bash Script Recipes\nCreate your own simplified bash recipes for tasks that you do repetitively. The recipes could string together several bash commands underneath, but you have abstracted them for quick use\n\n\nI.C. What is in it for you\nThe bash script recipes discussed here are intended for 2 purposes. The reader can 1. directly use the recipes in their day-to-day work (like a mini cookbook), or 2. use the recipes to learn the fundamentals and create their own recipes\n\n\nI.D. Prerequisites\n\nUnderstanding of what a Bash is, what are the different types of Bash terminals, how Bash and Linux Kernel interactions could be helpful. This important theory is out of the purview of this blog.\n\n\nPic Source: Intro to Unix (uc.edu course) | Refer here if interested\n\nNot mandatory, but other helpful pre-reading material:\n\nGoogle’s Shell Scripting Style guide: When to use a Shell Script | how to write function and comments\nWhich Shell to use"

The Bash CLI Recipes\nGeneric Recipes for everyone\n\nsearch_file & search_file_with_regex\nsearch_string_with_regex & search_n_replace_with_string\nmanage_files\ninside_csv\nclear_cache through a scheduler\nAWS Recipes\n\nEach of the recipes has the following details:\n\nCore Function\nLearnings\nHow to run it as a bash command\n\nYou can always use your own data to run the recipes. If you would like to replicate what I have, follow below instructions. For sections II.1 and II.2, we are using using this github repo as dataset to play with - Download the data as follows\n# in any new directory of yours\nmkdir -p dir_to_run_bash_scripts && cd dir_to_run_bash_scripts\ncurl -L https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Bash-Cookbook/archive/refs/heads/master.zip -O && mv master.zip Bash-Coolbook.zip\nunzip Bash-Coolbook.zip\nFor section II.4, use this csv file:\ncurl https://github.com/altair-viz/vega_datasets/blob/master/vega_datasets/_data/la-riots.csv &gt;&gt; la-riots.csv\n\nII. 1. Searching Files\nRecipe Title: search_file\n\nCore Function in the bash script search_file.bash\nfunction search_file_in_a_dir()\n{\n    find \"$1\" -type f -name \"$2\"\n}\nLearnings:\n\nfind allows to search for a file recursively under every dir in a specific dir\nParameters such as are passed to functions as positional arguments\n\nHow to run the bash script as a command:\n% search_file -d ./dir_to_search -f \"*partial_file_to_search*\"\n% search_file -f \"some_partial_file_name*\" # OR search_file -f \"full_file_name\"\nFor full recipe details and bash outputs, refer here\n\nRecipe Title: search_file_with_regex\n\nCore Functions in the bash script search_file_with_regex.bash\nfunction 1_search_file_in_a_dir()\n{\n    find \"$1\" -type f\n}\n\nfunction 2_to_treat_space_in_file_path()\n{\n    sed \"s| |?|g\"\n}\n\nfunction 3_isolate_file_name()\n{\n    rev | cut -d'/' -f1 | rev\n}\n\nfunction 4_run_regex_file_search()\n{\n    grep -E \"$2\"\n}\n\nfunction main_function()\n{\n    1_search_file_in_a_dir $1 | \\\n    2_to_treat_space_in_file_path | \\\n    3_isolate_the_file_name | \\\n    4_run_regex_file_search $2\n}\n\n# in one line, the above command is \n# find \"$1\" -type f |  sed \"s| |?|g\" | rev | cut -d'/' -f1 | rev | grep -E \"$2\"\nLearnings:\n\nNote the piping ( | ) in the main function search_regex_file_in_a_dir\nThere may be space in a file path. E.g.: “/path/to/an amazing dir/a file name.csv”\nsed (streaming editor) is introduced here to find_and_replace a space as we are parsing the output of find which could have space\n3_isolate_file_name function isolates the filename in the end by the dir separator “/”\ngrep -E allows for execution of regex filtering on the previous output we have piped\nIn a regex search, [ . * ( ) ] + are metacharacters. If you need to match them as is, escape with a backslash. E.g.: “[0-9]+_[a-z]+.sh” will match a file_name like “02_some_file_name.sh”\nWhile you can use “*” in search_file but not here search_file_with_regex\n\nHow to run the bash script as a command:\n# if you know the source directory where to search\n% search_file_with_regex -d ./dir_to_search -rf \"[0-9]+_[a-z]+\\.sh\"\n# if you do not know the directory where to search, we will search from $HOME\n% search_file_with_regex -rf \"some_regex_pattern\" \nFor full recipe details and bash outputs, refer here\n\n\n\nII. 2. Searching Strings\nRecipe Title: search_string\n\nCore Function\nfunction search_a_string()\n{\n    find \"$1\" -type f -name \"$2\" -exec grep -H -n -E \"$3\" -o {} \\;\n}\nLearnings:\n\n-exec which will direct grep to search inside every matching file from find\ngrep -n gives out number of line that matches\ngrep -o outputs the matched string\ngrep -E allows “Extended” Regex patterns as input\n\nHow to run the bash script as a command:\n# do note, it need not be just regex_pattern search, \n# even a normal word as is will also be fetched\n% search_string -d dir_name -f file_name -s regex_search_string\n# if you do not know directory or type of file, \n# you can simply do the below search string itself\n% search_string -s regex_search_string\n# example\n# search_string -d \"/some/dir\" -f \"*.sh\" -s \"[a-z_]+\\(\\)\"\nFor full recipe details and bash outputs, refer here\n\nRecipe Title:search_n_replace_strings\n\nCore Function:\nfunction search_n_replace_the_string()\n{\n    search_string=\"$1\"\n    replacement_string=\"$2\"\n    full_file_path=\"$3\"\n    echo \"$search_string\" \n    echo \"$replacement_string\"\n    sed -i'.original' -e \"s|$search_string|$replacement_string|g\" $full_file_path\n}\nLearnings:\n- `sed -i ''`` command replaces the file in-place and leaves no backup. If you want a backup, you could give something like this `sed -i '.backup' to retrieve the original file later`\nHow to run the bash script as a command: (refer here)\n# if you do not know directory, you can specify the other 3 parameters\n% search_n_replace_strings -f filename -s search_string -r replacement_string\nFor full recipe details and bash outputs, refer here\n\n\n\nII.3.

It executes the commands in create_aws_environment_variables in every terminal and hence persisting the environment variables like REGION, AWS_PROFILE, AWS_ACCOUNT_ID in your current terminal\nNote the source command which sources the manage_multiple_aws_accounts.bash script\n\n\n\nRun the script (this is as usual)\n# keep the AWS Credentials copied \n# from your aws_sso_start url like https://my-sso-portal.awsapps.com/start\nany/location/in/your/terminal % manage_multiple_aws_accounts --region ap-south-1\n\nCopied Credentials successfully\nAWS PROFILE: 123456789_DevOps-Engineer\nLogging into the AWS ACCOUNT: 123456789\nYou have chosen Region: ap-south-1\n\nIf you are a DevOps personnel, you may be interested in a fully AWS CLI solution | refer link\n\nFor full recipe details, refer here\nThere are two sample AWS recipes created from scratch using AWS CLI and some basic bash commands.

    "text": "III. Natural Language 2 Bash (NL2Bash) using LLMs …\nNL2Bash can be done both via Paid and Free LLMs. 1. If you are not constrained by budget, a paid Large Language Model based option is possible for productional use. Do explore AI-Shell and Yolo , powered by ChatGPT. 2. If you want a fully local and free version, there is the repo Ollama for Mac OS, which simplifies running llama2 locally.\nIf there is a solid case for giving users/developers a Natural Language way of accessing the application, the NL2Bash is a really good option.\nIn fact, in the same API, NL2Py or NL2SQL can also be implemented to interact with your application.\nNL2bash is truly exciting. However, if you won’t be running an extensively varied list of bash commands, then using an NL option is akin to using a bulldozer to mow a lawn. You’d be better off mowing the old-fashioned way with custom Bash recipes like the ones mentioned above, which leave no memory footprint and execute exceptionally swiftly."

    "text": "IV. Concluding Remarks\nAt its core, the bash script recipes discussed here consist of just a simple transformation\nfunction a_specific_function()\n{\n    # some simple transformation\n}\nSource: Refer Google’s Bash Scripting Style Guide\nIt is NOT a replacement for Python or Rust or even a Taskfile. Neither are the languages a replacement for Bash. But in combination with your core programming language, they are really powerful.\nIf I take some technical liberty, you did not execute bash scripting when you used find , grep, sed and awk, you actually leveraged really efficiently written C codes (source). Unequivocally, it is a great skill in your toolbox.\nBash scripting is foundational to Software Engineering and more pervasive than you think. If you have used git, docker, kubectl or even just mkdir & cd, you have tip-toed into bash scripting. Why not dive in?\nHappy Bash Scripting !"

DataLoader can also be used along with torch.multiprocessing - torchvision.datasets and torchtext.datasets are both subclasses of torch.utils.data.Dataset (they have getitem and len methods implemented) and also they can be passed to a torch.utils.data.DataLoader\nWhat does normalization do?:  - Changes the range of the data - When one pixel value is 15 and another pixel is 190, the higher pixel value will deviate the learning\nWhy do we do normalization of data before training a DL: - Prediction accuracy is better for normalized data - Model can learn faster if data is normalized\nMore details on PyTorch Primitives\n\ntorchvision.datasets –&gt; to use pre-existing datasets like FashionMNIST, coco, cifar, etc.,\ntorchvision.datasets have arguments/parameters to transform featuers (aka inputs) and target_transform to transform labels (like one hot encoding of labels\nCustomDatasetClass must overwrite the magic methods of python such as - __init__, __getitem__ and __len__ methods inherited from Dataset\ntorchvision.transforms.ToTensor (to transform/modify the features) and torchvision.transforms.Lambda (to transform the target/labels) - torchvision.transforms.ToTensor() converts features to normalized tensors - torchvision.transforms.Lambda could be used to transform labels - Lambda(lambda y: torch.zeros(number_of_classes,dtype=torch.float).scatter_(dim=0, index=torch.tensor(y), value=1)                 ) - Tensor.scatter_ is used to change values of a tensor variable at specified indices\n\n\n1A.

    "section": "2.1 Introduction to AWS Identity and Access Management",
    "text": "2.1 Introduction to AWS Identity and Access Management\n\nWHAT IS IAM?\n\nIAM (Identity and Access Management) is a web service for managing access to AWS accounts and resources.\n\nProvides centralized control of:\n\nAuthentication → who/what can enter the account\n\nAuthorization → who/what can use specific resources\n\n\nBenefits of IAM:\n\nShare access without exposing root credentials (email/password or access keys)\n\nGrant granular permissions so users/services only access what they need\n\nExample: give a user read-only access to specific actions/resources in one service\n\n\n\n\nGET TO KNOW THE IAM FEATURES\n\nIAM is global → not tied to a specific Region (accessible from any Region).\n\nIntegrated by default with many AWS services.\n\nSupports password policies (complexity rules, rotation).\n\nSupports MFA for stronger security.\n\nSupports identity federation → users can access AWS with existing credentials (e.g., corporate network, identity provider).\n\nFree to use → no additional charge for IAM.\n\n\n\nWHAT IS AN IAM USER?\n\nAn IAM user represents a person or service that interacts with AWS.\n\nDefined within your AWS account → all activity is billed to your account.\n\nIAM users can sign in to access AWS resources.\n\nYou can create multiple users as needed (e.g., team members on a project).\n\nEach user should have their own login credentials → prevents credential sharing.\n\n\n\nIAM USER CREDENTIALS\n\nAn IAM user has a name and a set of credentials.\n\nWhen creating a user, you can provide:\n\nConsole access → username + password\n\nProgrammatic access → access keys for AWS CLI or AWS API\n\n\nIAM user credentials are permanent until rotated by admins.\n\nPermissions can be granted directly to users, but:\n\nWorks only for a few users\n\nBecomes hard to manage at scale (e.g., thousands of users)\n\n\nBest practice: Group IAM users and assign permissions at the group level.\n\n\n\nWHAT IS AN IAM GROUP?\n\nAn IAM group is a collection of IAM users.\n\nAll users in a group inherit the group’s permissions → easier, scalable permission management.\n\nBest practice: Organize groups by job function (e.g., developers, security, admins).\n\nExamples:\n- New developer joins → add to developer group (no need to assign permissions individually).\n- User changes role → move from one group to another (permissions updated automatically).\nKey features of groups:\n- A group can have many users.\n- A user can belong to multiple groups.\n- Groups cannot belong to other groups.\n⚡ Contrast with root user:\n- Root user = full access to all resources by default.\n- New IAM users/groups/roles = no permissions by default until explicitly granted.\n- Permissions in IAM are granted through IAM policies.\n\n\nWHAT IS AN IAM POLICY?\n\nIAM policies manage access and permissions to AWS services/resources.\n\nPolicies can be attached to users, groups, or roles.\n\nWhen a request is made, AWS evaluates:\n\nPolicies on the user/role\n\nPolicies on any groups the user belongs to\n\n\nExample: A developer in the developers group → AWS checks both the group policies and the user’s policies to decide allow/deny.\n\n\n\nIAM POLICY EXAMPLES\nMost policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents with several policy elements. Take a look at the following example of what providing admin access through an IAM identity-based policy looks like.\n{\n\n\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",    \n     \"Statement\": [{        \n          \"Effect\": \"Allow\",        \n          \"Action\": \"*\",        \n          \"Resource\": \"*\"     \n     }]\n}\n\nAn IAM policy has four key JSON elements:\n\nVersion → defines the policy language version.\n\nAlways use \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\" for full feature support.\n\n\nEffect → specifies whether to Allow or Deny access.\n\nAction → describes the allowed/denied actions.\n\n\"*\" = wildcard → all actions.\n\n\nResource → defines which resources are affected.\n\n\"*\" = all resources.\n\n\nExample: Policy with \"Action\": \"*\" and \"Resource\": \"*\" → grants administrator access (all actions on all resources).\n\n{\"Version\": \"2012-10-17\",    \n     \"Statement\": [{        \n          \"Effect\": \"Allow\",        \n          \"Action\": [            \n               \"iam: ChangePassword\",            \n               \"iam: GetUser\"            \n               ],        \n          \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/${aws:username}\"    \n     }]\n}\n\nMore granular example:\n\nAllows a user to:\n\niam:ChangePassword (change their own password)\n\niam:GetUser (get info about their own user)\n\n\nUses variable substitution ${aws:username} → limits permissions to the specific user only.\n\n\n\n\nUNDERSTAND POLICY STRUCTURE\nWhen creating a policy, it is required to have each of the following elements inside a policy statement."

    "section": "4.1 Introduction to Networking in AWS",
    "text": "4.1 Introduction to Networking in AWS\n\nWHAT IS NETWORKING?\nNetworking is how you connect computers around the world and allow them to communicate with one another. In this trail, you’ve already seen a few examples of networking. One is the AWS global infrastructure. AWS has created a network of resources using data centers, Availability Zones, and Regions.\n\n\nKNOW THE NETWORKING BASICS\nThink about sending a letter. When sending a letter, there are three pieces of information you need. - Sender - Receiver - Payload content\nLet’s go further. Each address must contain information such as:\n\nName of sender and recipient\nStreet\nCity\nState or province\nZip, area, or postal code\nCountry\n\nYou need all parts of an address to ensure that your letter gets to its destination. Without the correct address, postal workers are not able to properly deliver the message. In the digital world, computers handle the delivery of messages in a similar way. This is called routing.\n\n\nWHAT ARE IP ADDRESSES?\nIn order to properly route your messages to a location, you need an address. Just like each home has a mail address, each computer has an IP address. However, instead of using the combination of street, city, state, zip code, and country, the IP address uses a combination of bits, 0s and 1s.\nIt’s called 32-bit because you have 32 digits of 0s and 1s.\n\n\nWHAT IS IPV4 NOTATION?\nTypically, you don’t see an IP address in this binary format. Instead, it’s converted into decimal format and noted as an Ipv4 address.\nIn the diagram below, the 32 bits are grouped into groups of 8 bits, also called octets. Each of these groups is converted into decimal format separated by a period.\n\nIn the end, this is what is called an Ipv4 address. This is important to know when trying to communicate to a single computer. But remember, you’re working with a network. This is where CIDR Notation comes in.\n\n\nUSE CIDR NOTATION\n192.168.1.30 is a single IP address. If you wanted to express IP addresses between the range of 192.168.1.0 and 192.168.1.255, how can you do that?\nOne way is by using Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. CIDR notation is a compressed way of specifying a range of IP addresses. Specifying a range determines how many IP addresses are available to you.\nCIDR notation looks like this:\n192.168.1.0/24\nIt begins with a starting IP address and is separated by a forward slash (the “/” character) followed by a number. The number at the end specifies how many of the bits of the IP address are fixed. In this example, the first 24 bits of the IP address are fixed. The rest are flexible.\n# first 24 of the 32 bits are fixed \n192.168.1.0/24\n\n# 192 - Fixed \n# 168 - Fixed\n# 1 - Fixed\n# last 8 bits - Flexible \n\n# each of the last 8 bits can take 0 or 1 - so two choices. \n# hence 2^8 = 256 IP addresses possible\nWhen working with networks in the AWS Cloud, you choose your network size by using CIDR notation. In AWS, the smallest IP range you can have is /28, which provides you 16 IP addresses. The largest IP range you can have is a /16, which provides you with 65,536 IP addresses.\n\n\nMy Interactions with ChatGPT on Networking\n\n# Q) What should be the right CIDR range to choose for my VPC? What factors dictate that? \nWhen should I choose a CIDR /24 or CIDR/28 and CIDR/16 range of ip addresses?\n\nAns: \nFactors that decide the range of the IP addresses: \n1. Size of the Network\n2. Subnets\n3. Growth and Scalability\n4. Private vs Public Subnets\n5. Peering and Inter-VPC Connectivity\n6. Service Endpoints & NAT Gateways\n\nSummary: \n/16: Best for large networks with many subnets, services, or where future scaling is critical.\n/24: Suitable for mid-sized networks with a moderate number of subnets.\n/28: Best for small networks, testing environments, or scenarios with very few resources.\n\nNote: On `Subnets`\n\nAWS reserves 5 IP addresses in every subnet, so in smaller CIDR blocks like /28 (where 16 IP addresses are available), you only have 11 usable IPs. Remaining 5 get used for subnets"

    "section": "4.2 Introduction to AWS VPC and its main services",
    "text": "4.2 Introduction to AWS VPC and its main services\n3 Requirements to set up a VPC: 1. The name of your VPC. 2. A Region for your VPC to live in. Each VPC spans multiple Availability Zones within the Region you choose. 3. A IP range for your VPC in CIDR notation. This determines the size of your network. Each VPC can have up to four /16 IP ranges.\n\n\n4.2.1 Create a Subnet:\nAfter you create your VPC, you need to create subnets inside of this network. Think of subnets as smaller networks inside your base network—or virtual area networks (VLANs) in a traditional, on-premises network. In an on-premises network, the typical use case for subnets is to isolate or optimize network traffic. In AWS, subnets are used for high availability and providing different connectivity options for your resources.\n\nSubnet is a subset of VPC. The size of Both Subnets and VPCs are indicated with CIDR notation. A VPC CIDR range is always bigger than its subnet CIDR range.\n\nWhen you create a subnet, you need to choose three settings. 1. The VPC you want your subnet to live in, in this case VPC (10.0.0.0/16). 2. The Availability Zone you want your subnet to live in, in this case AZ1. 3. A CIDR block for your subnet, which must be a subset of the VPC CIDR block, in this case 10.0.0.0/24.\nWhen you launch an EC2 instance, you launch it inside a subnet, which will be located inside the Availability Zone you choose.\nBelow is an image of an EC2 instance residing inside a public subnet\n\nHow to maintain high availability with a VPC?\n\nWhen you create your subnets, keep high availability in mind. In order to maintain redundancy and fault tolerance, create at least two subnets configured in two different Availability Zones.\n\nReserved IPs For AWS to configure your VPC appropriately, AWS reserves five IP addresses in each subnet. These IP addresses are used for routing, Domain Name System (DNS), and network management.\nWhat are those 5 Reserved IPs at every Subnet?\n\n\nFor example, consider a VPC with the IP range 10.0.0.0/22. The VPC includes 1,024 total IP addresses. This is divided into four equal-sized subnets, each with a /24 IP range with 256 IP addresses. Out of each of those IP ranges, there are only 251 IP addresses that can be used because AWS reserves five.\n\nSince AWS reserves these five IP addresses, it can impact how you design your network. A common starting place for those who are new to the cloud is to create a VPC with a IP range of /16 and create subnets with a IP range of /24. This provides a large amount of IP addresses to work with at both the VPC and subnet level.\n\n\n4.2.2 What is built in Public and Private Subnets\nExample Architecture Setup for Amazon.com or Facebook.com:\n\n\n**Public-facing Load Balancer (ALB or NLB) in a public subnet**:\n\n- The Load Balancer receives all incoming traffic (e.g., user requests to Amazon.com).\nIt distributes the traffic to a pool of web servers based on load and availability.\n\n**Web Servers**:\n- The web servers can be in either a public or private subnet. If they are in a public subnet, they have a public IP address but only accept traffic from the Load Balancer.\nIf they are in a private subnet, they do not have a public IP and can only receive traffic forwarded by the Load Balancer.\n\n\n**Backend Components (databases, APIs, etc.) in private subnets**:\n- These are isolated and only accessible from the web servers or other internal systems.\n- They cannot be accessed directly from the internet, ensuring sensitive data and services are protected.\n\n**NAT Gateway (optional for backend services)**:\n- Any backend instances in the private subnet that need to initiate outbound traffic (e.g., for updates, API calls) do so through a NAT Gateway.\n\nSummary:\n- Web Servers (like Amazon.com and Facebook.com) do need to allow inbound traffic for users to access their websites. However, this traffic is typically handled in a controlled and secure manner, often through Load Balancers and strict security group rules.\n- Backend systems, on the other hand, are usually hosted in private subnets and do not allow any unsolicited inbound traffic from the internet. They may make outbound requests through NAT Gateways or other secure channels.\n\n\nThe **key security principle** here is that inbound traffic is tightly controlled and usually mediated by a public-facing Load Balancer, while private subnets and backend systems remain isolated and protected from direct exposure to the internet.\n\n\n4.3 Gateways\n\n4.3.1 Internet Gateway\n\nTo enable internet connectivity for your VPC, you need to create an internet gateway.\n\n\nThink of this gateway as similar to a modem. Just as a modem connects your computer to the internet, the internet gateway connects your VPC to the internet. Unlike your modem at home, which sometimes goes down or offline, an internet gateway is highly available and scalable.\n\n\nAfter you create an internet gateway, you then need to attach it to your VPC.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Virtual Private Gateway\nA virtual private gateway allows you to connect your AWS VPC to another private network. Once you create and attach a VGW to a VPC, the gateway acts as anchor on the AWS side of the connection. On the other side of the connection, you’ll need to connect a customer gateway to the other private network. A customer gateway device is a physical device or software application on your side of the connection.\n\nOnce you have both gateways, you can then establish an encrypted VPN connection between the two sides.\n\n\n\n4.3.2 NAT Gateway\nNAT Gateway stands for Network Address Translation Gateway. The name “NAT” is derived from the process of Network Address Translation, which allows a device (like an EC2 instance) with a private IP address to communicate with external systems (like the internet) by translating its private IP into a public IP for outbound traffic.\nWhy is it called “NAT Gateway”? Network Address Translation (NAT): This is the key process behind the name. NAT allows instances in a private subnet (with only private IP addresses) to send traffic to the internet by translating their private IP addresses to a public IP address as they pass through the NAT Gateway. Gateway: It acts as a “gateway” or bridge between instances in a private subnet and external destinations, like the internet.\nPrimary Function: Outbound Internet Traffic A NAT Gateway is primarily designed to allow outbound internet access from instances in a private subnet, while preventing inbound traffic from the internet. When an instance in a private subnet needs to download updates or communicate with a service on the internet, it sends the request to the NAT Gateway. The NAT Gateway then makes the request on behalf of the instance using its own public IP and routes the response back to the instance.\nImportant Characteristics: - Outbound-only: - NAT Gateway is designed for outbound traffic only from private subnets to the internet. It does not allow incoming traffic initiated from the internet to reach instances in private subnets.\n\nSecurity:\n\nSince instances behind a NAT Gateway do not have public IP addresses, they are not directly reachable from the internet, enhancing security.\n\n\nSummary: NAT Gateway enables instances in private subnets to connect to the internet (e.g., to download updates or communicate with external APIs), but does not allow inbound internet traffic. It serves as a way to hide the private IP addresses of those instances from external systems while enabling them to make outgoing connections.\n\nOutbound vs. Inbound Traffic Breakdown Outbound Traffic refers to traffic initiated by an instance (in your private subnet) that goes out to the internet. When you send a request to download an update or access an external API, this is outbound traffic because the instance is initiating the connection.\nInbound Traffic refers to traffic initiated from the internet towards your instance. For example, a web server accepting a request from an external user would be receiving inbound traffic.\nKey Concept: Stateful Connections and Outbound Session NAT Gateways maintain stateful connections. When your instance starts a connection to the internet, the NAT Gateway tracks that connection. Any return traffic (like the update file) is automatically allowed because it is part of an ongoing session initiated by your instance. NAT Gateway does not allow new incoming connections initiated by the external source. It only forwards responses to requests that were initiated by the private instance (which keeps the session active)."

    "section": "4.4 Amazon VPC Routing and Security",
    "text": "4.4 Amazon VPC Routing and Security\n\n4.4.1 The Main Route Table\nWhen you create a VPC, AWS creates a route table called the main route table. A route table contains a set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed. AWS assumes that when you create a new VPC with subnets, you want traffic to flow between them. Therefore, the default configuration of the main route table is to allow traffic between all subnets in the local network.\n\nThere are two main parts to this route table.\n\nThe destination, which is a range of IP addresses where you want your traffic to go. In the example of sending a letter, you need a destination to route the letter to the appropriate place. The same is true for routing traffic. In this case, the destination is the IP range of our VPC network.\nThe target, which is the connection through which to send the traffic. In this case, the traffic is routed through the local VPC network.\n\n\n\n4.4.2 Custom Route Tables\n\nCustom Route Tables are Route Tables for specific subnets\n\ngranular way to route your traffic for specific subnets.\n\n\n\nIf you associate a custom route table with a subnet, the subnet will use it instead of the main route table. By default, each custom route table you create will have the local route already inside it, allowing communication to flow between all resources and subnets inside the VPC.\n\n\n\n\n4.4.3 Secure Your Subnets with Network ACLs\nA NACL (Network Access Control List) is a stateless firewall at the subnet level in AWS that controls inbound and outbound traffic to and from subnets.\n\nNetwork ACL’s are considered stateless, so you need to include both the inbound and outbound ports used for the protocol. If you don’t include the outbound range, your server would respond but the traffic would never leave the subnet.\n\n\n\nNote the non modifiable rules in both inbound and outbound\n\n\n\n4.4.4 Secure Your EC2 Instances with Security Groups\n\n\nDefault Security Group Behaviour: Denies all inbound traffic by default, allows all outbound by default\n\nIf you have a web server, you may need to accept HTTP and HTTPS requests to allow that type of traffic in through your security group. You can create an inbound rule that will allow port 80 (HTTP) and port 443 (HTTPS) as shown below.\n\n\n\n4.4.5 Port 80 vs Port 443:\nQ) 1. What does port 80 and port 443 signify? \n2. What does HTTP request and HTTPS request ? How are these 2 requests different\n\n&gt; Port 80 (HTTP): When your browser makes an HTTP request over port 80, the communication is unencrypted. \n- Anyone intercepting the data between the browser and server can read the content in plaintext.\n- HTTP requests are typically used on websites where security is not a concern (e.g., static informational sites).\n\nE.g.: `http://` websites\n\n&gt; Port 443 (HTTPS): When your browser makes an HTTPS request over port 443, the communication is encrypted using SSL/TLS. This means:\n- The data is securely encrypted and can only be decrypted by the server and client.\n- HTTPS requests are used on websites where security is important (e.g., banking, e-commerce, login forms).\n\nE.g.: `https://` websites\n\n\n\nThis example allows you to define three tiers and isolate each tier with the security group rules you define. In this case, you only allow internet traffic to the web tier over HTTPS, Web Tier to Application Tier over HTTP, and Application tier to Database tier over MySQL. This is different from traditional on-premises environments, in which you isolate groups of resources via VLAN configuration. In AWS, security groups allow you to achieve the same isolation without tying it to your network."

    "text": "4.6 10 Common network troubleshooting steps for Amazon VPC\nBelow is a list of configurations you should check if you ever have a public EC2 instance with a web application that is not loading as expected.\n\nInternet gateway &gt; Is IGW attached to VPC? &gt; Without the internet gateway, no traffic will be allowed in or out of the VPC.\nRoute tables\n\n\nDoes the route table of the subnet that has the EC2 application have destination as 0.0.0.0/0 and target as igw ? This route allows outbound traffic to the internet and makes the subnet a public subnet\n\n\nSecurity groups\n\n\nBy default all inbound traffic is blocked. Make sure there are inbound rules allowing HTTP (port 80) and/or HTTPS (port 443) traffic from the internet (0.0.0.0/0). Also, verify that outbound rules allow traffic to leave the instance.\n\n\nNetwork Access Control Lists\n\n\nCheck the NACLs associated with the subnet that has the EC2 instance NACLs are stateless, so you must explicitly allow both inbound and outbound rules that allow the http and https rules to subnet\n\n\nPublic IP address (Most important one :))\n\n\nEnsure you have auto-assign IP address when launching EC2 instance\n\n\nHTTP vs HTTPS\n\n\nConfirm that your application is accessible via the correct protocol. If your application is configured for HTTPS, ensure SSL/TLS certificates are correctly installed and configured. Also, check if the web browser is trying to connect via the wrong protocol (HTTP instead of HTTPS or vice versa). For this course, the application is operating via HTTP, double check that your browser is not trying to connect via HTTPS. You can do this by selecting the address bar in the browser and making sure the address starts with http and not https.\n\n\nUser data script\n\n\nIf your instance uses a user data script to configure the application on launch, verify that the script has run successfully.\n\n\nCheck the instance logs (/var/log/cloud-init.log or /var/log/cloud-init-output.log) for any errors that may have occurred during the execution of the user data script.\n\n\nPermissions (another important one)\n\n\nVerify the permissions and roles attached to your EC2 instance. Ensure the instance has the necessary IAM roles and policies to access any required AWS services, such as S3, DynamoDB, or RDS.\n\n\nPersonal network permissions\n\n\nEnsure that your personal or corporate network does not have restrictions blocking access to the public IP address of your EC2 instance.\n\n\nSome networks might have firewalls or proxy settings that could block outbound traffic to certain IP ranges or ports.\n\n\nApplication Code Logs\n\n\nEnsure that your application code is correctly deployed and running. Check the application’s logs to diagnose any runtime errors. Also, make sure the web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) is installed and running."

The file also has a path, for example, computer/Application_files/Cat_photos/cats-03.png. When you need to retrieve a file, your system can use the path to find it in the file hierarchy.\n\n\nEvery additional folder adds latency to the structure\n\nUsecases: - Large content repositories - Development environments - User home directories\n\n\n5.1.2 Block Storage\n\nWhile file storage treats files as a singular unit, block storage splits files into fixed-size chunks of data called blocks that have their own addresses. Since each block is addressable, blocks can be retrieved efficiently.\n\n\n\n\n5.1.2 Object Storage\n\nVery similar to File Storage but no hierarchical storage\nFlat structure\nEach object is a file with a unique identifier. This identifier, along with any additional metadata, is bundled with the data and stored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile Storage\nObject Storge\n\n\n\n\nHierarchy - YES; Folder or tree-like structure\nFlat Structure.

That means, if an accident happens and the computer goes down, you still have your data on your external drive. The same is true for EBS volumes.\n\n\nYou’re limited to the size of the external drive, since it has a fixed limit to how scalable it can be. For example, you may have a 2 TB external drive and that means you can only have 2 TB of content on there. This relates to EBS as well, since volumes also have a max limitation of how much content you can store on the volume.\n\n\n\n5.2.3 How to scale Amazon EBS Volumes\n\nIncrease the volume size, as long as it doesn’t increase above the maximum size limit. For EBS volumes, the maximum amount of storage you can have is 16 TB. That means if you provision a 5 TB EBS volume, you can choose to increase the size of your volume until you get to 16 TB.\nAttach multiple volumes to a single Amazon EC2 instance. EC2 has a one-to-many relationship with EBS volumes. You can add these additional volumes during or after EC2 instance creation to provide more storage capacity for your hosts.\n\n\n\n5.2.4 Two types of AMIs for EC2 Instances\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n  AMI(AMI)\n  AMI1[[Instance Store&lt;br&gt;Backed AMI]]\n  AMI2[[EBS-Volume&lt;br&gt;backed AMI&lt;br&gt;most common]]\n  AMI --&gt; AMI1\n  AMI --&gt; AMI2   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Points: - When EC2 running on instance-store backed AMI is stopped, data is lost. - Instance-store backed AMIs are useful for stateless applications - It can be rebooted without losing data\n\n\n5.2.5 Latency vs Throughput discussion\nLatency: - Amount of time it takes for ONE data packet to reach its destination - For databases and Web &lt;-&gt; Server Interactions\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  W[Web Server] -- 1 packet sent&lt;br&gt; in 10 millisec --&gt; C[Client]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughput: - Number of packets that can reach a destination within 1 sec - Needed in Big Data Analytics\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  W[Web Server] -- 10 packets sent&lt;br&gt; in 1 sec --&gt; C[Client]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.6 Types of EBS Volumes\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart TD\n  EBS(EBS Volumes)\n  subgraph SSD\n    EBS_SSD(EBS SSD)\n    SSD1[[EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD]]\n    SSD2[[EBS General Purpose SSD]]\n    EBS_SSD --&gt; SSD1\n    EBS_SSD --&gt; SSD2\n    SSD1 --&gt; app1((for latency sensitive&lt;br&gt;workloads))\n    app1 --&gt; ex1((E.g.

    "section": "5.3: Object Storage with Amazon S3",
    "text": "5.3: Object Storage with Amazon S3\n\n5.3.1 WHAT IS AMAZON S3? UNDERSTAND AMAZON S3 CONCEPTS\n\nAmazon S3 is an object storage service.\nObject storage stores data in a flat structure, using unique identifiers to look up objects when requested. An object is simply a file combined with metadata and that you can store as many of these objects as you’d like.\nAll of these characteristics of object storage are also characteristics of Amazon S3.\n\n\n\n\n5.3.2 Security for S3 Objects\n\nEverything is private by default\n\n\nIf you decide that you want everyone on the internet to see your photos, you can choose to make your buckets, folders, and objects public. Keep in mind that a public resource means that everyone on the internet can see it. Most of the time, you don’t want your permissions to be all or nothing. Typically, you want to be more granular about the way you provide access to your resources.\n\nAmazon S3 provides two main access management features: IAM policies and S3 bucket policies.\n\n\n5.3.3 When should one use S3 bucket policies:\n\nWhen you need a simple way to do cross-account access to S3, without using IAM roles.\nYour IAM policies bump up against the defined size limit. S3 bucket policies have a larger size limit.\n\n\nS3 Bucket policies can only be placed on buckets, and cannot be used for folders or objects.\n\n\n\n5.3.3 ENCRYPT S3\nAmazon S3 reinforces encryption in transit (as it travels to and from Amazon S3) and at rest. To protect data at rest, you can use:\nServer-side encryption: This allows Amazon S3 to encrypt your object before saving it on disks in its data centers and then decrypt it when you download the objects.\nClient-side encryption: Encrypt your data client-side and upload the encrypted data to Amazon S3. In this case, you manage the encryption process, the encryption keys, and all related tools.\n\n\n5.3.4 USE VERSIONING TO PRESERVE OBJECTS\nVersioning-enabled buckets let you recover objects from accidental deletion or overwrite.\n\nDeleting an object does not remove the object permanently. Instead, Amazon S3 puts a marker on the object that shows you tried to delete it. If you want to restore the object, you can remove this marker and it reinstates the object.\n\n\nIf you overwrite an object, it results in a new object version in the bucket. You still have access to previous versions of the object.\n\nBuckets can be in one of three states.\n\nUnversioned (the default): No new or existing objects in the bucket have a version.\nVersioning-enabled: This enables versioning for all objects in the bucket.\nVersioning-suspended: This suspends versioning for new objects. All new objects in the bucket will not have a version. However, all existing objects keep their object versions.\n\n\n\n5.3.5 AMAZON S3 STORAGE CLASSES\nHere are the main types of Amazon S3 storage options:\n\nS3 Standard Use Case: Frequently accessed data. Availability: 99.99%. Durability: 99.999999999% (11 nines). Performance: Low latency, high throughput. Cost: Higher cost compared to other classes. Typical Uses: Websites, content distribution, data analytics, and mobile applications.\nS3 Intelligent-Tiering Use Case: Data with unpredictable access patterns. Availability: 99.9%. Durability: 99.999999999% (11 nines). Performance: Automatically moves data between two access tiers (frequent and infrequent) to optimize cost. Cost: Slightly higher than Standard but saves on infrequently accessed data by automatically moving data to lower-cost storage tiers.\nS3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) Use Case: Data that is infrequently accessed but requires rapid access when needed. Availability: 99.9%. Durability: 99.999999999% (11 nines). Cost: Lower storage cost, higher retrieval cost compared to S3 Standard. Typical Uses: Backups, disaster recovery, long-term storage.\nS3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) Use Case: Infrequently accessed data that doesn’t require multi-zone redundancy. Availability: 99.5%. Durability: 99.999999999% (11 nines) within a single Availability Zone. Cost: Lower cost than S3 Standard-IA. Typical Uses: Data that can be recreated easily, backups, or secondary copies.\nS3 Glacier\n\nUse Case: Long-term archive storage where retrieval time can range from minutes to hours. Availability: 99.99%. Durability: 99.999999999% (11 nines). Cost: Very low storage cost, retrieval incurs additional cost and delay. Typical Uses: Archival data, regulatory compliance, and historical records.\n\nS3 Glacier Deep Archive Use Case: Long-term archive for data that is rarely accessed and has retrieval times of up to 12 hours. Availability: 99.99%. Durability: 99.999999999% (11 nines). Cost: Lowest-cost storage option in S3, with higher retrieval times. Typical Uses: Long-term data retention for compliance or legal purposes.\nS3 Outposts Use Case: Storing data on-premises for applications that need local data residency. Durability: Same as S3 (99.999999999%). Typical Uses: Local workloads that need low latency or local data processing, and when compliance requires data to stay on-premises.\n\n\n\n5.3.6 AUTOMATE TIER TRANSITIONS WITH OBJECT LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT\nWhen you define a lifecycle policy configuration for an object or group of objects, you can choose to automate two actions: transition and expiration actions.\n\nTransition actions are used to define when you should transition your objects to another storage class.\nExpiration actions define when objects expire and should be permanently deleted.\n\nThe following use cases are good candidates for lifecycle management.\n\nPeriodic logs: If you upload periodic logs to a bucket, your application might need them for a week or a month. After that, you might want to delete them.\nData that changes in access frequency: Some documents are frequently accessed for a limited period of time. After that, they are infrequently accessed. At some point, you might not need real-time access to them, but your organization or regulations might require you to archive them for a specific period. After that, you can delete them.\n\n\n\n5.3.7 AWS Storage Services Recap\n\nAmazon EC2 Instance Store\n\nInstance store is ephemeral block storage\nFor stateless applications\n\n\nEC2 Instance Store is not meant for data that is persistent or long-lasting. If you need persistent long-term block storage that can be detached from Amazon EC2 and provide you more management flexibility, such as increasing volume size or creating snapshots, then you should use Amazon EBS.\n\n\n\nAmazon EBS\nAmazon EBS is meant for data that changes frequently and needs to persist through instance stops, terminations, or hardware failures. Amazon EBS has two different types of volumes\n\nSSD - For I/O-sensitive workloads\nHDD - For Throughput-intensive workloads\n\n\n\nAmazon S3\n\nIt is object storage.\nYou pay for what you use (you don’t have to provision storage in advance).\nAmazon S3 replicates your objects across multiple Availability Zones in a Region.\nAmazon S3 is not storage attached to compute.\n\n\n\nAmazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) and Amazon FSx\n\nAlso Serverless\nNo need to provision in advance\nPay for what you use"

Here’s a breakdown, along with AWS examples:\n\n1. Database\n\nPurpose: A database is designed to store structured data that can be easily queried and updated. It’s typically used for transactional processing (OLTP: Online Transaction Processing) where you need to manage day-to-day operations like inserts, updates, and deletes efficiently.\nData Type: Structured data (e.g., relational data with tables, rows, and columns).\nUse Cases: Applications like inventory management, customer management, e-commerce websites, or any app that involves a lot of concurrent, real-time transactions.\nAWS Example:\n\nAmazon RDS (Relational Database Service): Supports databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle. It’s managed, which means AWS takes care of backups, patching, and scaling.\nAmazon DynamoDB: A NoSQL database for high-speed, low-latency performance, often used for large-scale applications that require flexible data models.\n\n\nExample Use Case: An e-commerce website storing customer orders and product information in Amazon RDS for efficient querying and real-time updates.\n\n\n\n2. Data Warehouse\n\nPurpose: A data warehouse is optimized for analytical processing (OLAP: Online Analytical Processing) where large volumes of structured data are aggregated and analyzed. It is ideal for complex queries, reporting, and business intelligence (BI) tasks.\nData Type: Primarily structured data, although it may support semi-structured data (e.g., JSON or Parquet formats). Data is typically cleaned and organized before loading into a data warehouse.\nUse Cases: Business analytics, trend analysis, data mining, generating reports or dashboards across large data sets (e.g., sales trends across regions or customer segments).\nAWS Example:\n\nAmazon Redshift: A fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse designed for fast query execution across large datasets. Redshift is built for complex queries and analytics, and it integrates well with BI tools like Amazon QuickSight.\n\n\nExample Use Case: A retail company uses Amazon Redshift to analyze sales data across regions to understand seasonal buying trends and forecast future demand.\n\n\n\n3. Data Lake\n\nPurpose: A data lake is a centralized repository that allows you to store structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data at any scale. It’s highly flexible and is often used to store raw data until it’s needed for analysis. It supports various formats (e.g., JSON, CSV, images, video, text logs) and allows for big data analytics and machine learning.\nData Type: Structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (e.g., documents, audio, videos, logs, sensor data).\nUse Cases: Data exploration, machine learning, big data analytics, and situations where you want to store a vast array of data types before deciding what analysis or processing you need.\nAWS Example:\n\nAmazon S3 (Simple Storage Service): Typically used to build a data lake in AWS. You can store any type of data in its native format and then later analyze it using other AWS services like AWS Glue (for data transformation), Amazon Athena (for querying), or Amazon EMR (for big data processing).\n\n\nExample Use Case: A healthcare company uses Amazon S3 to store vast amounts of raw patient data, including medical images, doctor notes, and sensor data from wearables. They later process this data for machine learning models and analytics.\n\n\n\nKey Differences:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nDatabase (RDS/DynamoDB)\nData Warehouse (Redshift)\nData Lake (S3)\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Use\nTransactional (OLTP)\nAnalytical (OLAP)\nStore raw data, Big Data\n\n\nData Type\nStructured\nStructured, Semi-structured\nStructured, Semi-structured, Unstructured\n\n\nProcessing\nReal-time transactions\nAggregated, Complex queries\nData exploration, batch processing\n\n\nAWS Service\nAmazon RDS, DynamoDB\nAmazon Redshift\nAmazon S3\n\n\nExample\nE-commerce apps, customer orders\nBusiness analytics, dashboards\nRaw data for analytics, ML\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of AWS Services:\n\nDatabase → Amazon RDS for relational databases or DynamoDB for NoSQL databases.\nData Warehouse → Amazon Redshift for OLAP and analytical workloads.\nData Lake → Amazon S3 to store large datasets in various formats for big data analytics.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Q) Are all AWS Databases in EC2 instances? Are they named as db.xxx ?\nNo, not all AWS databases run on EC2 instances, and they are not named as db.xxx by default. While some database services in AWS may use EC2 instances under the hood, many of them are fully managed services, meaning you don’t need to worry about the underlying EC2 infrastructure. Let me explain further:\n\n1. Managed Databases (Not necessarily tied to EC2 instances)\nAWS provides fully managed databases, which abstract away the underlying infrastructure, including EC2 instances, networking, and scaling. With these services, AWS handles most operational tasks like backups, patching, scaling, and failover.\nHere are some examples of fully managed AWS database services: - Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service): A managed service for relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and MariaDB. It is designed to handle the operational management of these databases, though the actual database may run on EC2 instances in the background. As a user, you don’t have direct access to the underlying EC2 instances.\n\nAmazon Aurora: A high-performance, MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud. Like RDS, Aurora abstracts away the EC2 instances, providing a managed environment.\nAmazon DynamoDB: A fully managed NoSQL database that scales horizontally. It doesn’t require EC2 instances, and you don’t need to manage the underlying servers or instances.\nAmazon Redshift: A managed data warehouse that allows you to run analytics on structured data. While Redshift clusters are backed by EC2 instances, you manage them at a higher level through the Redshift interface.\nAmazon DocumentDB: A fully managed MongoDB-compatible database that abstracts away the underlying EC2 instances.\n\nIn these fully managed services, the database instances are not explicitly named as db.xxx; instead, you interact with these services through their respective APIs or consoles without seeing the underlying infrastructure. However, you may define instance identifiers or cluster names like “db1” when provisioning databases, but this is customizable.\n\n\n2. Self-Managed Databases on EC2 (Named as db.t3.medium, etc.)\nIf you self-manage a database on an EC2 instance, then you directly control the EC2 infrastructure. In this case, you would need to handle database installation, patching, backups, scaling, and networking yourself. You could launch a database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) on an EC2 instance, and here you would see the EC2 instance types named in the t3, m5, db.m6g, or similar families.\nSome instance types in RDS do use naming patterns like db.m6g.large, but this is specific to Amazon RDS and Aurora, which provide a managed environment on top of EC2. For example: - db.t3.medium (RDS instance) → This is an instance class used for databases in Amazon RDS, where t3.medium is an EC2 instance type optimized for general-purpose workloads, but the naming convention here indicates that it’s used for a database (db. prefix).\n\n\n\nSummary:\n\nNot all AWS databases run on EC2 instances. Services like DynamoDB and Aurora abstract the infrastructure so you don’t manage EC2s directly.\nIn Amazon RDS, the underlying instances may be named as db.xxx (e.g., db.t3.medium), but this is specific to the RDS service.\nIf you’re running a database directly on EC2, you choose standard EC2 instance types like t3.medium, and you’re responsible for managing the database yourself.\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Q) So a PostgreSQL DB can be either Self-Managed Databases on EC2 or AWS Managed ?\nYes, in AWS, a PostgreSQL database can be deployed in two primary ways:\n\nSelf-Managed on EC2:\n\nDescription: You launch a PostgreSQL database on an EC2 instance, essentially creating a self-managed environment where you control the entire database stack.\nResponsibilities: You handle installation, configuration, patching, backup, scaling, and security management.\nFlexibility: Full control over the PostgreSQL settings, customizations, and extensions.\nUse Case: Ideal if you need custom configurations or PostgreSQL plugins that aren’t supported in managed services, or if you want to control the environment entirely.\n\nAWS Managed PostgreSQL (Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora):\n\nDescription: Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL and Amazon Aurora (PostgreSQL-compatible) are fully managed database services that AWS operates.\nResponsibilities: AWS handles provisioning, patching, backup, scaling, and automatic failover. You only need to manage data, schema, and performance tuning.\nFlexibility: Limited to configurations and extensions that AWS supports.\nUse Case: Best for users who prefer a managed, highly available, and scalable PostgreSQL solution without the administrative overhead.\n\n\nSo, self-managed on EC2 gives you complete control and flexibility, whereas AWS-managed services offer ease of use and reduced operational burden at the cost of some customization flexibility."

    "section": "8.4 Route Traffic with Amazon Elastic Load Balancing",
    "text": "8.4 Route Traffic with Amazon Elastic Load Balancing\n\n8.4.1 What is a Load Balancer:\n\nPurpose is to distribute the requests across all the servers hosting the application using a load balancer\n\nLoad balancing refers to the process of distributing tasks across a set of resources. In the case of the corporate directory application, the resources are EC2 instances that host the application, and the tasks are the different requests being sent. It’s time to distribute the requests across all the servers hosting the application using a load balancer.\nTo do this, you first need to enable the load balancer to take all of the traffic and redirect it to the backend servers based on an algorithm. The most popular algorithm is round-robin, which sends the traffic to each server one after the other.\nA typical request for the application would start from the browser of the client. It’s sent to a load balancer. Then, it’s sent to one of the EC2 instances that hosts the application. The return traffic would go back through the load balancer and back to the client browser. Thus, the load balancer is directly in the path of the traffic.\nAlthough it is possible to install your own software load balancing solution on EC2 instances, AWS provides a service for that called Elastic Load Balancing (ELB).\n\n\n8.4.2 FEATURES OF ELB\nThe ELB service provides a major advantage over using your own solution to do load balancing, in that you don’t need to manage or operate it. It can distribute incoming application traffic across EC2 instances as well as containers, IP addresses, and AWS Lambda functions.\n\nThe fact that ELB can load balance to IP addresses means that it can work in a hybrid mode as well, where it also load balances to on-premises servers.\nELB is highly available. The only option you have to ensure is that the load balancer is deployed across multiple Availability Zones.\nIn terms of scalability, ELB automatically scales to meet the demand of the incoming traffic. It handles the incoming traffic and sends it to your backend application.\n\n\n\n8.4.3 HEALTH CHECKS\nTaking the time to define an appropriate health check is critical. Only verifying that the port of an application is open doesn’t mean that the application is working. It also doesn’t mean that simply making a call to the home page of an application is the right way either.\nFor example, the employee directory application depends on a database, and S3. The health check should validate all of those elements. One way to do that would be to create a monitoring webpage like “/monitor” that will make a call to the database to ensure it can connect and get data, and make a call to S3. Then, you point the health check on the load balancer to the “/monitor” page.\n\nAfter determining the availability of a new EC2 instance, the load balancer starts sending traffic to it. If ELB determines that an EC2 instance is no longer working, it stops sending traffic to it and lets EC2 Auto Scaling know. EC2 Auto Scaling’s responsibility is to remove it from the group and replace it with a new EC2 instance. Traffic only sends to the new instance if it passes the health check.\nIn the case of a scale down action that EC2 Auto Scaling needs to take due to a scaling policy, it lets ELB know that EC2 instances will be terminated. ELB can prevent EC2 Auto Scaling from terminating the EC2 instance until all connections to that instance end, while preventing any new connections. That feature is called connection draining.\n\n\n8.4.4 ELB COMPONENTS\n\n\nListeners: The client connects to the listener. This is often referred to as client-side. To define a listener, a port must be provided as well as the protocol, depending on the load balancer type. There can be many listeners for a single load balancer.\nTarget groups: The backend servers, or server-side, is defined in one or more target groups. This is where you define the type of backend you want to direct traffic to, such as EC2 Instances, AWS Lambda functions, or IP addresses. Also, a health check needs to be defined for each target group.\nRules: To associate a target group to a listener, a rule must be used. Rules are made up of a condition that can be the source IP address of the client and a condition to decide which target group to send the traffic to.\n\n\n\n8.5 APPLICATION LOAD BALANCER\n\nGranular routing: Routes traffic based on HTTP request data (URL path, host, headers, method, source IP).\n\nDirect responses: Can send fixed responses (e.g., HTML) or redirects (e.g., HTTP → HTTPS).\n\nTLS offloading: Handles HTTPS traffic with SSL certificates from IAM or AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).\n\nUser authentication: Supports OpenID Connect and integrates with SAML, LDAP, Microsoft AD, etc.\n\nTraffic security: Uses security groups to restrict allowed IP ranges.\n\nRound-robin routing: Distributes requests evenly across servers.\n\nLeast outstanding requests routing: Balances load by sending new requests to servers with fewer pending requests.\n\nSticky sessions: Uses HTTP cookies to keep traffic from a client directed to the same backend server.\n\nProtocol scope: Supports HTTP and HTTPS only; use Network Load Balancer (NLB) for other protocols.\n\n\n\n8.6 NLB\n\nProtocol support: Works with TCP, UDP, and TLS. Operates at the connection layer, so it does not understand HTTP/HTTPS.\n\nFlow hash routing: Routes traffic based on protocol, source/destination IP and port, and TCP sequence number.\n\nSticky sessions: Based on the client’s source IP address (not cookies like ALB).\n\nTLS offloading: Can terminate TLS to reduce backend server load.\n\nHigh performance: Instantly handles millions of requests per second (no warm-up needed).\n\nStatic and Elastic IPs: Supports direct client connections via fixed IP addresses—useful for DNS-restricted or firewall-rule scenarios.\n\nSource IP preservation: Passes the client’s real IP address to the backend (unlike ALB, which shows the LB’s IP)."

    "text": "8.7 Intro to Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling\nAvailability and reachability is improved by adding one more server. However, the entire system can again become unavailable if there is a capacity issue. Let’s look at that load issue with both types of systems we discussed, active-passive and active-active.\n\n8.7.1 Vertical Scaling\n\n\nActive-Passive vs Active-Active Systems in Scaling\nWhen too many requests are sent to a single active-passive system, the active server becomes unavailable and (hopefully) fails over to the passive server.\nBut this doesn’t really solve the problem.\n\nWhy Active-Passive Needs Vertical Scaling\n\nActive-Passive systems rely on vertical scaling (increasing server size).\n\nWith EC2 instances, this means:\n\nChoosing a larger instance type\nOr switching to a different type\n\n\nLimitation: Scaling can only be done when the instance is stopped.\n\n\n\nSteps for Vertical Scaling in Active-Passive\n\nStop the passive instance (safe, since it’s not receiving traffic).\n\nChange the instance size or type, then start it again.\n\nShift traffic to the passive instance (making it active).\n\nStop, resize, and start the previous active instance (so both match).\n\n\n\nDrawbacks of Active-Passive Scaling\n\nManual and repetitive work each time traffic changes.\n\nA server can only scale vertically up to a limit.\n\nOnce the limit is reached, the only option is to:\n\nCreate another active-passive system\nSplit requests and functionalities across them\n\n(Often requires massive application rewriting)\n\n\n\n\nActive-Active Advantage\n\nWith active-active systems, scaling is horizontal.\n\nInstead of making servers bigger, you simply add more servers.\n\nThis approach is easier, more flexible, and avoids rewriting applications.\n\n\n\n\n8.7.2 Horizontal Scaling\n\nActive-active system works well because the application is stateless (no client sessions stored on the server).\n\nScaling from 2 → 4 servers requires no code changes.\n\nJust add or remove instances as needed.\n\nAmazon EC2 Auto Scaling handles this automatically:\n\nCreates new EC2 instances when traffic increases.\n\nTerminates instances when traffic decreases.\n\nKey advantage:\n\nActive-active + stateless apps = true scalability.\n\nMuch more efficient compared to active-passive systems.\n\n\n\n\n8.7.3 Integrate ELB with EC2 Auto Scaling\n\nELB and Auto Scaling Integration\nThe ELB service integrates seamlessly with EC2 Auto Scaling. As soon as a new EC2 instance is added to or removed from the EC2 Auto Scaling group, ELB is notified. However, before it can send traffic to a new EC2 instance, it needs to validate that the application running on that EC2 instance is available.\nThis validation is done via the health checks feature of ELB. Monitoring is an important part of load balancers, as it should route traffic to only healthy EC2 instances. That’s why ELB supports two types of health checks:\n\nTCP Health Check: Establishing a connection to a backend EC2 instance using TCP, and marking the instance as available if that connection is successful.\n\nHTTP/HTTPS Health Check: Making an HTTP or HTTPS request to a webpage that you specify, and validating that an HTTP response code is returned.\n\n\n\n\nTraditional Scaling vs Auto Scaling\n\nTraditional Scaling\n\nWith a traditional approach to scaling, you buy and provision enough servers to handle traffic at its peak.\n\nAt low traffic times (e.g., nighttime), there is more capacity than traffic.\n\nThis leads to wasted money, since turning off servers only saves electricity, not provisioning costs.\n\n\n\nCloud (Auto Scaling) Approach\n\nCloud uses a pay-as-you-go model.\n\nIt’s important to turn off unused services, especially EC2 instances that run On-Demand.\n\nManual scaling can work for predictable traffic, but unusual spikes cause:\n\nOver-provisioning → wasted resources.\n\nUnder-provisioning → loss of customers.\n\n\n\n\nSolution → EC2 Auto Scaling\n\nAutomatically adds and removes EC2 instances based on conditions you define.\n\nEnsures the right number of EC2 instances are running at any time.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.7.4 Using Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling\nThe EC2 Auto Scaling service works to add or remove capacity to keep a steady and predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. By adjusting the capacity to exactly what your application uses, you only pay for what your application needs. And even with applications that have steady usage, EC2 Auto Scaling can help with fleet management. If there is an issue with an EC2 instance, EC2 Auto Scaling can automatically replace that instance. This means that EC2 Auto Scaling helps both to scale your infrastructure and ensure high availability."

    "section": "8.8 Configure EC2 Auto Scaling Components",
    "text": "8.8 Configure EC2 Auto Scaling Components\nThere are three main components to EC2 Auto Scaling.\n\n\nLaunch template or configuration:\n\n\nWhat resource should be automatically scaled?\nA configuration of parameters are used to create a EC2 instance\nAMI\nSecurity Group associated with the EC2 Instance\nEC2 Instance Type\nAdditional EBS Volumes\nmore\n\n\n\nAll of these information are needed by EC2 Auto Scaling to create the EC2 instances on our behalf\n\n\n\nEC2 Auto Scaling Group (ASG): Where should the resources be deployed? and How many should be deployed?\n\n\nWhere do you deploy the EC2 instances created via EC2 Auto Scaling - VPC - Subnets across different Availability Zones - Type of EC2 instance purchase: On-demand, Spot ?\nHow many EC2 instances should the ASG create? - Minimum - Maximum - Desired\n\n\nScaling policies: When should the resources be added or removed?\n\n\n\nScaling policy can be set based on metrics like CPU utilization, measured via a CloudWatch Alarm\n\n\n8.8.1 Learn About Launch Templates\n\n\nThere are multiple parameters required to create EC2 instances:\n\nAmazon Machine Image (AMI) ID\n\nInstance type\n\nSecurity group\n\nAdditional Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) volumes\n\nAnd more…\n\nAll this information is also required by EC2 Auto Scaling to create the EC2 instance on your behalf when there is a need to scale.\n\nThis information is stored in a launch template.\n\n\n\nLaunch Template Usage\n\nYou can use a launch template to manually launch an EC2 instance.\n\nYou can also use it with EC2 Auto Scaling.\n\nIt supports versioning, which allows:\n\nQuickly rolling back if there was an issue.\n\nSpecifying a default version of your launch template.\n\nIterating on a new version while other users continue launching EC2 instances with the default version.\n\n\n\n\n\nWays to Create a Launch Template\n\nUsing an existing EC2 instance (fastest way, since all settings are already defined).\n\nFrom an existing template or a previous version of a launch template.\n\nFrom scratch, where you need to define:\n\nAMI ID\n\nInstance type\n\nKey pair\n\nSecurity group\n\nStorage\n\nResource tags\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\nAnother way to define what Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling needs to scale is by using a launch configuration.\n\nHowever, a launch configuration:\n\nDoes not support versioning.\n\nCannot be created from an existing EC2 instance.\n\n\nFor these reasons, and to ensure that you get the latest features, use a launch template instead of a launch configuration.\n\n\n\n\n8.8.2 Get to Know EC2 Auto Scaling Groups\n\nThe next component that EC2 Auto Scaling needs is an EC2 Auto Scaling Group (ASG).\n\nAn ASG enables you to define where EC2 Auto Scaling deploys your resources.\n\nThis is where you specify the Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and subnets the EC2 instance should be launched in.\n\nEC2 Auto Scaling takes care of creating the EC2 instances across the subnets.\n\nIt’s important to select at least two subnets that are across different Availability Zones (AZs).\n\nASGs also allow you to specify the type of purchase for the EC2 instances:\n\nOn-Demand only\n\nSpot only\n\nCombination of On-Demand and Spot (lets you take advantage of Spot instances with minimal admin overhead).\n\nTo specify how many instances EC2 Auto Scaling should launch, configure three capacity settings for the group size:\n\nMinimum: The minimum number of instances running in your ASG, even if the threshold for lowering the amount of instances is reached.\n\nMaximum: The maximum number of instances running in your ASG, even if the threshold for adding new instances is reached.\n\nDesired capacity: The target number of instances in your ASG.\n\nThis number must be within or equal to the minimum and maximum.\n\nEC2 Auto Scaling automatically adds or removes instances to match this number.\n\n\n\n\n\nMinimum capacity\n\nEC2 Auto Scaling keeps removing EC2 instances until it reaches the minimum capacity.\n\nBest practice: set at least two instances to ensure high availability.\n\nEven if scaling down is instructed, EC2 Auto Scaling won’t remove instances below the minimum.\n\nMaximum capacity\n\nWhen traffic grows, EC2 Auto Scaling keeps adding instances.\n\nCosts will also increase as more instances are added.\n\nSetting a maximum ensures the number of instances doesn’t exceed your budget.\n\nDesired capacity\n\nThis is the number of EC2 instances created when the Auto Scaling group is launched.\n\nIf the desired capacity decreases, Auto Scaling removes the oldest instance by default.\n\nIf it increases, Auto Scaling creates new instances using the launch template.\n\nEnsure availability with EC2 Auto Scaling\n\nMinimum, maximum, and desired capacity can be set to different values for dynamic scaling.\n\nIf you want Auto Scaling only for fleet management, configure all three to the same value (e.g., 4).\n\nEC2 Auto Scaling will replace unhealthy instances to always maintain that count, ensuring high availability.\n\n\n\n\n\n8.8.3 Enable Automation with Scaling Policies\n\nASG Desired Capacity\n\nBy default, ASG stays at its initial desired capacity.\n\nDesired capacity can be manually changed or adjusted with scaling policies.\n\nScaling policies use CloudWatch metrics & alarms (e.g., CPU &gt; 70%) to trigger scaling actions.\n\nTypes of Scaling Policies\n\nSimple Scaling Policy\n\nUses a CloudWatch alarm to add/remove instances or set desired capacity.\n\nCan use a fixed number or a percentage of group size.\n\nIncludes a cooldown period to avoid premature scaling while new instances boot.\n\nLimitation: can’t handle multiple thresholds (e.g., 65% vs 85%).\n\nStep Scaling Policy\n\nHandles multiple thresholds with incremental actions.\n\nExample:\n\n+2 instances if CPU ≥ 85%\n\n+4 instances if CPU ≥ 95%\n\n\nResponds to alarms even if scaling activity is still in progress.\n\nTarget Tracking Scaling Policy\n\nSimplest and most dynamic option.\n\nSet a target value (e.g., avg CPU %, network in/out, request count).\n\nAutomatically creates and manages the required CloudWatch alarms."

Underfitting and Overfitting\nUnderfitting - Capacity Increase - If you increase the number of neurons in each layer (making it wider), it will learn the “linear” relationships in the features better - If you add more layers to the network (making it deeper), it will learn the “non-linear” relationships in the features better - Decision on Wider or Deeper networks depends on the dataset\nOverfitting - Early Stopping: Interrupt the training process when the validation loss stops decreasing (stagnant) - Early stopping ensures the model is not learning the noises and generalizes well\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\n\nOnce we detect that the validation loss is starting to rise again, we can reset the weights back to where the minimum occured.\n\nKeras Version:\nfrom tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping\n# a callback is just a function you want run every so often while the network trains\n\n# defining the early_stopping class\nearly_stopping = EarlyStopping(min_delta = 0.001, # minimum about of change to qualify as improvement\n                               restore_best_weights=True,\n                               patience=20, # number of epochs to wait before stopping\n                              )\n\n\nhistory = model.fit(X_train, y_train, \n    validation_data=(X_valid,y_valid),\n    batch_size=256,\n    epoch=500,\n    callbacks=[early_stopping],\n    verbose=0 #turn off logging\n    )\n    \nhistory_df = pd.DataFrame(history.history)\nhistory_df.loc[:, ['loss', 'val_loss']].plot();\nprint(\"Minimum validation loss: {}\".format(history_df['val_loss'].min()))\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nPyTorch Version: - In PyTorch, there is no built-in EarlyStopping callback like in Keras\n\n# Define the early stopping criteria\nclass EarlyStopping:\n    def __init__(self, min_delta=0.001, restore_best_weights=True, patience=20):\n        self.min_delta = min_delta\n        self.restore_best_weights = restore_best_weights\n        self.patience = patience\n        self.counter = 0\n        self.best_loss = None\n        self.early_stop = False\n\n    def __call__(self, loss):\n        if self.best_loss is None:\n            self.best_loss = loss\n        elif loss &gt; self.best_loss + self.min_delta:\n            self.counter += 1\n            if self.counter &gt;= self.patience:\n                self.early_stop = True\n        else:\n            self.best_loss = loss\n            self.counter = 0\n\n# Instantiate the early stopping class\nearly_stopping = EarlyStopping()\n\n# Training loop\nfor epoch in range(num_epochs):\n    # Train the model and compute the loss\n    model.train()\n    # ...\n    loss = loss_function(outputs, targets)\n    \n    # Call the early stopping function and check for early stopping\n    early_stopping(loss)\n    if early_stopping.early_stop:\n        print(\"Early stopping!\")\n        break\n\n    # ...\n    # Other training loop code\n# After training, if restore_best_weights=True, you can load the best weights\nif early_stopping.restore_best_weights:\n    model.load_state_dict(torch.load('best_model_weights.pt'))\n\n\n5.D. Batch Normalization\nWhy BatchNorm? - Can prevent unstable training behaviour - the changes in weights are proportion to how large the activations of neurons produce - If some unscaled feature causes so much fluctuation in weights after gradient descend, it can cause unstable training behaviour - Can cut short the path to reaching the minima in the loss curve (hasten training) - models with BatchNorm tend to need fewer epochs for training\nWhat is BatchNorm? - On every batch of data subjected to training - normalize the batch data with the batch’s mean and standard deviation - multiply them with rescaling parameters that are learnt while training the model\nKeras Version:  Three places where BatchNorm can be used 1. After a layer\nkeras.Sequential([\n    layers.Dense(16,activation='relu'),\n    layers.BatchNormalization(),\n    ])\n\nin-between the linear dense and activation function\n\nkeras.Sequential([\n    layers.Dense(16),\n    layers.BatchNormalization(),\n    layers.Activation('relu')\n    ])\n\nAs the first layer of a network (role would then be similar to similar to Sci-Kit Learn’s preprocessor modules like StandardScaler)\n\nkeras.Sequential([\n    layers.BatchNormalization(),\n    layers.Dense(16),\n    layers.Activation('relu')\n    ])\nPyTorch Version\nclass BinaryClassifier(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(BinaryClassifier, self).__init__()\n        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(10, 64)\n        self.batch_norm1 = nn.BatchNorm1d(64)\n        self.relu = nn.ReLU(inplace=True)\n        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 1)\n        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.fc1(x)\n        x = self.batch_norm1(x)\n        x = self.relu(x)\n        x = self.fc2(x)\n        x = self.sigmoid(x)\n        return x\n\n\n5.E. LayerNormalization\n\nIt seems that it has been the standard to use batchnorm in CV tasks, and layernorm in NLP tasks Source\n\n\nLayer normalization normalizes input across the features instead of normalizing input features across the batch dimension in batch normalization. … The authors of the paper claims that layer normalization performs better than batch norm in case of RNNs. Source\n\n\n\n5.F. Dropout\nWhat is Dropout? - It is NN way of regularizing data (to avoid overfitting) by - randomly dropping certain proportion of neurons in a layer\nHow Dropout regularizes? - It makes it harder for neural network to overfit for the noise\n\n\n\nimage\n\n\nkeras.Sequential([\n    # ....\n    layers.Dropout(0.5), # add dropout before the next layer\n    layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),\n    # ...\n\n])\nWhen adding Dropout, it is important to add more neurons to the layers\n# define the model\nmodel = keras.Sequential([\n    layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu',input_shape=[11],\n    layers.Dropout(0.3),\n    layers.Dense(512, activation='relu',\n    layers.Dense(1024),\n    layers.BatchNormalization(),\n    layers.Activation('relu'),\n    layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu'),\n    layers.Dropout(0.3),\n    layers.BatchNormalization(),\n    layers.Dense(1),\n])\n\n# compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mae')\n\n# fit the model\nhistory = model.fit(X_train, y_train,\n                    validation_set=(X_valid, y_valid),\n                    batch_size=256,\n                    epochs=100,\n                    verbose=1,\n)\n\n# plot the learning curves\nhistory_df = pd.DataFrame(history.history)\nhistory_df.loc[:, ['loss','val_loss']].plot()"
