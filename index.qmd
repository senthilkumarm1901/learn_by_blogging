<h1 align='center'>
  Hi there üëã I'm Senthil Kumar üë®‚Äçüíª
</h1>

<hr>

<p align='center'>
  I am an Applied ML Engineer specialized in building Natural Language Processing applications using ML and DL. <br>
  This is my blog <b><i>Learn by Blogging</i></b>
</p>

<p align='left'>
I'm here to pen my learnings in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Software Engineering. The range of my topics include various NLP topics, some mathematics fundamentals, a lot of coding concepts, Cloud related topics, tool tips and more. Predominantly, I write more code-first learning approaches to different topics. 
</p>

<p align='left'>
I understand what I write here could just be a drop in an ocean of good materials out there.
This is my humble attempt to keep learning, unlearning and relearning as much as possible by writing about them.
</p>

<p align='center'>
Hit me up in LinkedIn if what I do interests you !
