<h1 align='center'>
  Hi there 👋 I'm Senthil Kumar 👨‍💻
</h1>

<hr>

<p align='center'>
  I am an Applied AI Engineer with expertise in building production-grade NLP & GenAI applications in Cloud using ML, DL, and LLM APIs.
</p>

<p align='left'>
  To break it down, I am ... <br>
  - a **Generative AI Engineer** immersed in the development of Agentic apps and LLM API-powered products <br>
  - an **AWS Cloud Engineer** specialized in developing & deploying event-driven serverless architectures <br>
  - an **applied ML Engineer** capable of leveraging deep learning models for inferencing in NLP applications <br>
  
  This is my blog <b><i>Learn by Blogging</i></b>
</p>

<p align='left'>
I'm here to pen my learnings in Generative AI, Cloud, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Software Engineering.

<p align='left'>
I understand what I write here could just be a drop in an ocean of good materials out there.
This is my humble attempt to keep learning, unlearning and relearning as much as possible by writing about them.
</p>

<p align='center'>
Hit me up in LinkedIn if what I do interests you !
