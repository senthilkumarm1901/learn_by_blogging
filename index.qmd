# Hi there 👋 I'm Senthil Kumar 👨‍💻
> * I am an Applied AI & Cloud Engineer

✦ My Journey: 

 - More than 15 years ago, I started out as a 📈 Market Research Analyst.  
 - With every role I took on after that, the technology side of the pie kept growing, 
    - through analytics, data science 📊 and deep learning 🌐, 
    - eventually leading me to my current role as an Applied AI 🧠 and Cloud Engineer at Toyota

## 🧭 What I Do

I work at the intersection of:

- **Generative AI**: Building agentic systems and LLM-powered applications  
- **Cloud Engineering**: Designing architectures on AWS, especially serverless
- **Applied ML**: Deploying deep learning models for real-world NLP use cases

## 🧠 How I Learn by Blogging

- This blog is my way of thinking in public.
- I write to clarify concepts, test mental models, and document engineering lessons as I learn them.
- Writing forces precision. It turns half-understood ideas into structured understanding.
