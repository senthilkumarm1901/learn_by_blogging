<h1 align='center'>
Hi there 👋 I'm Senthil Kumar 👨‍💻
</h1>

<p align='center'>
I design and deploy cloud-native AI systems — from foundational NLP to scalable agentic architectures.
</p>

## 🔎 What You'll Find Here

- Cloud-native LLM system design  
- Agentic AI architectures  
- AWS serverless patterns for AI workloads  
- NLP foundations explained clearly  
- Engineering productivity insights  

---

## 🧭 What I Do

I work at the intersection of:

- **Generative AI** — building agentic systems and LLM-powered applications  
- **Cloud Engineering** — designing event-driven serverless architectures on AWS  
- **Applied ML** — deploying deep learning models for real-world NLP use cases

## 🧠 How I Learn by Blogging

- This blog is my way of thinking in public.
- I write to clarify concepts, test mental models, and document engineering lessons as I learn them.
- Writing forces precision. It turns half-understood ideas into structured understanding.
