# 1. Introduction to AWS

## 1.  Introduction to AWS - The Critical Elements

- **Regions → AZs → Data Centers**
    
    - AWS Regions consist of **Availability Zones (AZs)**.
    - AZs consist of **one or more physical data centers**.


- **Root account first steps (non‑negotiable)**
    
    1. Enable **MFA** on the root user immediately
    2. Create an **IAM Administrator role**
        - Full service creation permissions
        - No account‑level or billing changes
    3. Lock away root credentials

- **IAM policies cannot restrict the root user**
    
    - Root user always has unrestricted access, regardless of IAM policies.

- **Shared Responsibility Model**
    
    - AWS = **security _of_ the cloud**
    - Customer = **security _in_ the cloud**

- Summary: **Every activity in AWS is an API call**
    
    - Console clicks, CLI commands, SDK calls → all become **authenticated & authorized AWS API requests**.

### Choose the Right AWS Region

**Essential takeaway:**  
Choose Region in this order:

1. **Compliance / data residency**
2. **Latency**
3. **Service availability**
4. **Cost**
5. **Availability & DR needs**

### Availability Zones

![](./images/regioin-az-datacenters.png){width=100%}

- Each **Region contains multiple AZs**
- Each **AZ = one or more data centers**
- Data centers are:
    - Physically separate
    - Redundantly powered and networked
- AZs are connected by **low‑latency, high‑bandwidth links**
- AZ names:
    - `<region><letter>` (example: `us-east-1a`)
    - Letter mappings differ per account
- Resource location example:
    - `us-east-1c` → AZ “c” inside `us-east-1`

### Scope of AWS Services

![](./images/aws_scope_and_responsibility_of_services_2.png)

**Scope summary:**

- **Global services**

    - Single logical control plane across AWS
    - Example: IAM, Route 53, CloudFront
- **Regional services**
    
    - Live within a Region, usually span multiple AZs
    - Example: S3, DynamoDB, VPC, RDS Multi‑AZ
- **Zonal services**
    
    - Bound to a single AZ
    - Example: EC2, EBS, RDS Single‑AZ

**Availability & durability:**

- Some services are **AWS‑managed**
- Others require **customer‑designed HA/DR**

---

### Maintain Resiliency

- Prefer **Region‑scoped managed services**
- Otherwise:
    - Deploy across **multiple AZs**
    - Minimum **two AZs**
- AZ failure ≠ application outage when designed correctly

---

### Security and the AWS Shared Responsibility Model

#### Core distinction

- **AWS responsibility (security of the cloud):**
    
    - Physical data centers
    - Hardware, networking
    - Host OS and virtualization layer
- **Customer responsibility (security in the cloud):**
    
    - IAM, access control
    - Data protection & encryption
    - Network security (SGs, NACLs)
    - Backups and recovery

> AWS manages the infrastructure.  
> You secure what you build on top of it.

## Protect the AWS Root User

### Authentication vs Authorization

- **Authentication:**  
    “Who are you?” (passwords, MFA, tokens)
    
- **Authorization:**  
    “What are you allowed to do?” (IAM policies)
    

---

### AWS Root User

- Created with the AWS account
- Has **full, unrestricted access**
- Credentials:
    - Email + password (console)
    - Access keys (programmatic)

**Critical facts:**

- IAM policies **cannot limit root**
- Root should never be used for daily work

---

### Root User Best Practices

- Enable **MFA**
- Strong, unique password
- **Delete root access keys**
- Use root **only** for:
    - Account setup
    - Billing
    - Rare account‑level tasks

---

### Why MFA Matters

- Passwords alone are weak
- MFA adds a second factor:
    - Something you know
    - Something you have
    - Something you are
- **Always enable MFA on root**

## Control Plane APIs and Data Plane APIs in AWS

* AWS describes control plane as administrative APIs (CRUDL) like “creating an S3 bucket”, while data plane includes “getting and putting objects in an S3 bucket

- Source: [Control Planes and Data Planes in AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/aws-fault-isolation-boundaries/control-planes-and-data-planes.html)

S3 **Control plane** APIs (AWS CLI examples)

✅ Create a bucket (control plane)

```bash
aws s3api create-bucket \
  --bucket my-example-bucket-123 \
  --region ap-south-1 \
  --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=ap-south-1
```

`create-bucket` “Creates a new S3 bucket.”

> * Rule of thumb: Anything *Bucket* (create bucket, put bucket encryption, put bucket policy, lifecycle, versioning…) is typically “control plane” style because you’re configuring the container and its behavior.

```bash
aws s3api delete-object \
  --bucket my-example-bucket-123 \
  --key docs/readme.txt
```

> * Rule of thumb: Anything *Object* (PutObject/GetObject/ListObjects/DeleteObject/HeadObject) is “data plane” because you’re interacting with the stored data.

---

## Summary: Every AWS Activity Is an API Call

![](./images/every_aws_service_use_is_an_api_call.png)

- Console, CLI, SDK → **AWS API**
- API calls are:
    - Authenticated
    - Authorized
    - Evaluated by IAM
- Understanding this explains:
    - IAM behavior
    - Auditing (CloudTrail)
    - Automation (IaC, CI/CD)
    - Security boundaries

> **By understanding APIs, IAM, Regions, AZs, and responsibility boundaries — one understands AWS.**
