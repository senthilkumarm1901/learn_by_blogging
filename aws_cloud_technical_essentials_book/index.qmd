# AWS Technical Essentials

> A strong engineer becomes exponentially more effective with AI — but only if the fundamentals are solid.

Over the last four years, I’ve worked deeply in cloud engineering.  
But I asked myself a hard question:

**Do I truly understand the foundations — or just operate at the surface?**

This book is my attempt to revisit AWS cloud fundamentals with:

- Practical engineering experience
- AI-assisted reasoning (LLMs to clarify edge cases)
- Visual mental models
- Hands-on AWS CLI experimentation

This book covers the following

## 🧱 What This Book Covers

This is a structured, visual walkthrough of core cloud building blocks:

- [**Foundations**](01-introduction.html) — Regions, Availability Zones, resiliency, shared responsibility
- [**Security**](02-security.html) — IAM, policies, roles, and the root user
- [**Compute**](03-compute.html) — EC2, containers, serverless
- [**Networking**](04-networking.html) — VPC, subnets, routing, security boundaries
- [**Storage**](05-storage.html) — S3, EBS, instance store tradeoffs
- [**Databases**](06-databases.html) — RDS, DynamoDB, data architecture decisions
- [**Monitoring**](07-monitoring.html) — CloudWatch, scaling, load balancing
- [**Optimization**](08-optimization.html) — Scaling, Performance tuning and cost optimization

Each section includes:

- 📊 Mermaid diagrams to visualize architecture
- 🧠 Conceptual breakdowns
- 🧪 AWS CLI examples (because every AWS activity is just an API call)
- ⚙️ Design thinking behind service choices

## 🧠 Why This Exists

AI can accelerate engineers. But AI cannot compensate for weak fundamentals.

The goal of this guide is simple:

> Rebuild cloud fundamentals with clarity, structure, and visual intuition.

If you're preparing for:

- AWS certification
- Architecture interviews
- Cross-cloud comparison (Azure / GCP)
- Or simply strengthening your cloud mental model

This book is meant to help, as it would help myself.

## 🌍 For Azure & GCP Engineers

If you’re working on Azure or GCP and find these visual models helpful,  
feel free to adapt the diagrams and mental frameworks for your own cloud journey.
