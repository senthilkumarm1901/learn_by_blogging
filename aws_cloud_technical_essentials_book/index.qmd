I’ve pulled together my notes on AWS Fundamentals — covering Security, Compute, Networking, Databases, and more — based on the AWS Technical Essentials course from Coursera.
I’ve also included my ChatGPT interactions, where I explored specific doubts and clarified tricky concepts along the way. This resource should be handy for anyone attempting to revise concepts before an AWS exam
