Below is a **bare‑minimum, distilled version** of your AWS Security notes — keeping only the concepts that actually matter long‑term and removing all repetition and teaching detail.

***

## AWS Security - Quick Notes

### 1. AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

*   **IAM controls authentication and authorization** for AWS accounts and resources.
*   Lets you **share access without using root credentials**.
*   Provides **fine‑grained, explicit permissions**.
*   **IAM is global** (not Region‑specific).
*   Supports **MFA, password policies, and identity federation**.
*   IAM itself is **free**.

***

### 2. IAM Identities

*   **IAM User**
    *   Represents a person or service.
    *   Has permanent credentials (console and/or programmatic).
    *   Should **not share credentials**.

*   **IAM Group**
    *   Collection of users.
    *   Permissions are assigned **to groups, not individuals**.
    *   Users can belong to multiple groups.

*   **IAM Role**
    *   No long‑term credentials.
    *   Uses **temporary credentials**.
    *   Preferred for:
        *   AWS services
        *   Federated users
        *   Cross‑account access

***

### 3. IAM Policies

*   **Policies define permissions** (allow/deny).
*   Attached to **users, groups, or roles**.
*   Evaluated on **every AWS API call**.
*   Core elements:
    *   `Effect` (Allow / Deny)
    *   `Action`
    *   `Resource`
*   `*` on action and resource = **full access**.
*   **Explicit deny always wins**.

***

### 4. Security Best Practices

*   **Lock down the root user**
    *   Enable MFA
    *   Delete root access keys
    *   Never use root for daily work

*   **Least privilege**
    *   Start with minimal access
    *   Grant only what is required

*   **Prefer roles over users**
    *   Avoid long‑lived access keys
    *   Reduce blast radius of credential leaks

***

### 5. Federation & Centralized Identity

*   Use an **Identity Provider (IdP)** when possible.
*   Grant access via **IAM roles**, not IAM users.
*   **AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO)**:
    *   Central user & permission management
    *   Works across multiple AWS accounts
    *   Integrates with external IdPs

***

### One‑Line Mental Model

> **IAM decides *who* can call *which AWS APIs* on *which resources*.**

## Deep Dive into IAM Policy

- **IAM policies** manage access and permissions to AWS services/resources.  
- Policies can be attached to **users, groups, or roles**.  
- When a request is made, AWS evaluates:  
  - Policies on the **user/role**  
  - Policies on any **groups** the user belongs to  
- Example: A developer in the **developers group** → AWS checks both the **group policies** and the **user’s policies** to decide allow/deny.  


### IAM POLICY EXAMPLES

Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents with several policy elements. Take a look at the following example of what providing admin access through an IAM identity-based policy looks like.

```json
{

"Version": "2012-10-17",    
     "Statement": [{        
          "Effect": "Allow",        
          "Action": "*",        
          "Resource": "*"     
     }]
}
```

- An **IAM policy** has four key JSON elements:  

  1. **Version** → defines the policy language version.  
     - Always use `"Version": "2012-10-17"` for full feature support.  
  2. **Effect** → specifies whether to **Allow** or **Deny** access.  
  3. **Action** → describes the allowed/denied actions.  
     - `"*"` = wildcard → all actions.  
  4. **Resource** → defines which resources are affected.  
     - `"*"` = all resources.  

- Example: Policy with `"Action": "*"` and `"Resource": "*"` → grants **administrator access** (all actions on all resources).  

```json
{"Version": "2012-10-17",    
     "Statement": [{        
          "Effect": "Allow",        
          "Action": [            
               "iam: ChangePassword",            
               "iam: GetUser"            
               ],        
          "Resource": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/${aws:username}"    
     }]
}
```

- More granular example:  
  - Allows a user to:  
    - `iam:ChangePassword` (change their own password)  
    - `iam:GetUser` (get info about their own user)  
  - Uses **variable substitution** `${aws:username}` → limits permissions to the **specific user** only.  

### UNDERSTAND POLICY STRUCTURE

When creating a policy, it is required to have each of the following elements inside a policy statement.
